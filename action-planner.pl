# Some actions are for things like respond to an email, from audience.
# have that be loaded into a KB.  How will the information be got from
# the remote host?  Is it time to test sending messages over from
# al. to this local server.

# Perhaps not, perhaps we can SCP one instance of the data over for
# testing purposes

# if we haven't received

# In order to determine what else should be done, we need to look at
# the goals of SPSE2, to see which tasks are most important

# We also need a system that reasons about shoring up and helping, and
# all of the other actions that are available to us.  there are so
# many potential todo actions, but let us develop an action ontology.
# we can use our existing todo lists to develop such an ontology.
# Perhaps we can put Kate Jelinski in charge of that, write her a GUI
# or what not.

# We should actively be trying to work with certain people, and
# determine who to work with at any given time in terms of their
# capacity to benefit the greatest number of people.  Justin should be
# tasked towards ethics research and ideas.  Should be able to use his
# operating system, but that means that collaboration will be slower
# for now.
