(a bot that can open connections to different machines)

(Something that knows what my plan is, i.e. to see the doctor,
and reminds me before I leave, or if with a phone, has the text,
of what I should tell the doctor.  This is auto correlated from
when I initially tell the AI that I need to tell the doctor X)

(A system for managing versions of data)

(A system that reminds me of important tasks and knows their
 prerequisites, i.e. has world knowledge about what to do)

(A system to warn me of upcoming bills)

(A system to scan my paperwork)

(A system to record the status of different types of goals)

(Develop a system to represent common arguments with refutations,
 so for instance, and opening book for political argumentation,
 and in it, place common arguments (Iran wants to destroy Israel,
 etc) and refutations)

(a shopping list for everything we need/want etc, and the cost to obtain it)

(a system to manage all my contacts and keep up to date on AI
 development with them)

(Something like LogicMoo)

(An agent framework that is more deliberative than Jason or Spark)

(A system to manage all my research papers and assert things about them)

(CycL interface for FreeKBS2)

(A system for recording notes and reasoning with the notes)

(A system to track the licenses of files)

(Something like BibleWorks but for Ireland)

(Develop a debt management system)

(A rule based system for executing certain task when certain
things become true, i.e. When I get home, clip fingernails)

(Have a system for analyzing todo lists)

(Have a system of deontic logic specify duties like keeping the
 paper pile empty, etc)

(Have a planning system that recognizes human language constructs
 regarding the properties of goals, such as this goal is
 absolutely essential (based on the theorem proving of the
 situation).  So for instance, if a singular item suddenly
 becomes super important, like a key to a door that must be
 opened for the situation to be moved forward, then express that
 importance the way a person would more or less.  In other words
 KB Chess instead of minimax.)
