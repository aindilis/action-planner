(Express the game position in temporal modal logic, or something
 equivalently expressive enough to deal with knowledge, belief, etc)

(investigate the interplay between the semantics of the logic and
 the "game" structure)

(involve multiple perspectives, possibly with a format like
 (implies (and (believes ?Person GoldenRule) (believes ?Person Y)) (has-move ?Person "Move"))
 You know, 
 )

(record the correct reasons for the move in the tst file)

(remember, beginners are always attacking, so develop a set
 of "moves" that are not "attari", that in other words put the
 house in order)

(allow open ended algorithms for achieving results, perhaps allow
 various libraries to be used in the computation of moves)
