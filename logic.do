;; here is some of what we want to do

;; have a legal move generator

;; have an ethical move generator

;; other kinds of move generators

;; be able to list common things that people should do with
;; particular objects

;; a project abandon, start, finish, postpone

;; a deadline - extend, complete

;; a goal complete, suspend, etc (items that are the same)


;; now we want to be able to say certain things about the situation

;; 


;; emphasize relationships between goals

;; same project, iff

;; more relationships, prefer-complete-before

;; fails-to-condition

;; has-failure-mode

;; semantic check domain
