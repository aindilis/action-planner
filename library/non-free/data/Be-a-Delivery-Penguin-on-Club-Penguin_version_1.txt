Say, "here is your order".

Dress like a baby girl.
Most girl scouts in real life are kids.
However, since most people on CP are kids and it's really hard to dress up as one, you'll have to dress up like a CP baby (from the pet shop).
Wear clothes that make you look a cute baby girl penguin.
Wear the brown/blue handbag.
Go to a person's igloo on the map.
Say, "Hwi".
(This is a baby mispronunciation of "hi"--don't forget to act cute!)
Say, "I sell cookies."
The owner of the igloo will pick what he/she wants.
Say, "Tank woo mister/wady."
Wear the delivery hat and outfit.(You can also wear a carrier bag, but you won't really need it, because you will deliver by truck.)
To deliver food, go to the mine shack and throw snowballs into the bucket.
When the food disappears and appears in the bay, go up to it and say,"picks up food","Puts food in truck","Gets in truck"and"drives off"
Walk to the plaza, don't teleport, but say"drives" when going through the forest.
Walk into the pizza parlour and say,"DELIVERY FOR PIZZA PARLOUR !!"
You then go out to your truck and take in the food.
Do the same thing with the pet shop and coffe shop.
