test.Make a list of your chores.
Write them down, and keep them at your desk or in your room.
Make sure you know what you have to do.
Feel free to add or deduct chores over time, life changes, so so should your list.
The appearance of your list doesn't matter.
Your list may be typed up in fancy print on fancy paper, or it could be on old notebook paper in your worst handwriting.
Your list is going to change, so typing it may be a waste of time, money, and paper, so you may just want to write it with a pencil so your eraser can get through, but, whatever works for you is fine!
It's your list!
Make a schedule.
Organize your time.
Write the amount of time it will take for all of your chores, and add it to your schedule.
Always put your school work first!
Do school work immediately when you get home, and then focus on your chores.
Your after school schedule may look a little something like this:
Do homework.
(Homework should take about ten minutes per grade level.
So if your in first grade, ten minutes, sixth, an hour.
Make sure to add that to your schedule).
Make my bed.
Dust.
Do the dishes.
Vacuum.
Take a couple rest breaks.
A simple five minute to ten minute break will keep you awake, and ready to do things.
They freshen your mind and keep you energized!
Take a short nap, shoot some hoops, or have a healthy snack.
Don't eat unhealthy foods.
They will make you energetic for a little, then wipped out way later.
When homework and chores are done, make plans and get out there ! Don't sit on the computer all night, get out and do something!
