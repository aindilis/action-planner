step)Unplug the toaster and move to a workspace where you have room to move.
Lay down a layer of newspaper to work over.
This will protect your kitchen workspace and also makes it easier to collect up the crumbs.
Clean the interior first.
To give the interior a thorough clean, add some large salt crystals through the toast slots.
Cover the toast slots with greaseproof paper and fasten with elastic or tape.
Shake the toaster up and down a few times to disperse the salt.
The salt cleans the toaster by helping to dislodge carbonised deposits as you shake.
As an added bonus, discourages pests that might crawl inside the toaster slots.
The only thing that you must be careful of with this method is to ensure that you empty all of the salt out or it may cause corrosion from the moisture of cooking toast products.
This is why the salt granules must be large.
Finish off by emptying the crumb tray over a piece of newspaper or over the garbage disposal unit.
Wipe the crumb tray clean over the sink using warm water and gentle liquid soap.
If your toaster lacks a crumb tray, turn it upside down and gently shake over the newspaper a few times.
