possibilities.If you think you are willing to dedicate yourself to the trials of becoming an astronaut, then make the decision as soon as possible so you have more time to prepare.
Get excellent grades in all your subjects in school.

There are two types of astronauts : pilots and mission specialists.
If you love flying and want to be a pilot, then you will need to be in the military.
Look into the ROTC programs, especially those of the Air Force and Navy at your college of choice.
Try to get a 4 year scholarship by having a 3.0 GPA from high school and a good ACT/SAT score.
If you want to be a mission specialist, then you need to be heavily involved and passionate about your subject of choice and get involved in the research community.
Once you have made it into college, you have a clear path ahead of you.
A bachelor's degree in math, physics, engineering, or science is required so make sure you're majoring in one of those.

Maintain your good grades, perform well in ROTC (if you're trying to be a pilot) and then once you are done it is really up to the military to decide what happens next.
Your ultimate goal in the military is to be a test pilot, those are the guys NASA wants the most because they have experience flying experimental aircraft.
