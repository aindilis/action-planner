1 Get together with some friends, and make a plan.
Early December is usually the best time to plan, so presents can be given before Christmas.
Choose a date which is best for everyone.
Anytime between 5th-18th December is good for most people.
Make sure none of your friends will be on holiday or busy on the day.
Pick a comfortable, easy place to meet.
Coffee shops are good, Starbucks would be a great place.
You could grab some warm drinks and have a chat before exchanging presents.
If your local coffee shop is in a department store or shopping centre, you could also do some last minute Christmas shopping if you need to.
Confirm the time.
Arranging it at night may not be good for everyone, and normally busy places are usually even busier at night during the festive season.
Try and get everyone there for morning, afternoon or evening to avoid the rush.
