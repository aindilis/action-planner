property.Focus on your partner.
The person to whom you intend to show affection must become your single point of attention.
You will be a great lover if they feel they are the only person in the world when they are with you.
That is the impression you are trying to make when you begin with focus.
Have some optimism.
You must be upbeat when expressing your sentiments to them, whether about them personally, the situation or the condition of the world at large--be an uplifting presence that helps them see the better things around them, especially about themselves
Make sure to listen, see and feel how the other person is responding to your attention at every step--the object here is to find the correct tempo that the other person is capable of hearing, seeing and fully feeling your expressions of affection.
This is about them, not about you having a stage and acting out--you are always seeking to understand their experience of you so you can again make it even better.
Show your enthusiasm.
You must express optimistic sentiments with a passion that is infectious to them.
Bring them a wave of positive emotions to carry them towards pleasures in themselves and the world around them and they will be yours forever.
Develop your humor.
After having enjoyed passions of the moment and retired from your warm, mutual cocoon of focus it is very important to not offer judgment about such experience with any great seriousness--be light, be self-deprecating and be natural in your sense of humor about yourself, the other and life in general.
This is the perfect tonic for Life as well.
