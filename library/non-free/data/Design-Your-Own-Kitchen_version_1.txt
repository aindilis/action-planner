metal!Consider your limitations.
When you are ready for a new kitchen or your first kitchen, it is important that you look at what you want to use the kitchen space for as part of your overall living space.
Ask yourself what you want to do in the kitchen.
Do you need a seating area?
Will the kitchen double as an office?
Does it need to be kid friendly?
Will you entertain guests in the kitchen?
Do you do a lot of cooking/baking?
How much time will you be spending in the kitchen?
All these things and more will need to be considered when planning the layout of the kitchen.
