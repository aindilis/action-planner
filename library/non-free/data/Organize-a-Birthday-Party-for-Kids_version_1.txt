communityPick a theme with your child.
He or she might want a licensed character (Sponge Bob, or Scooby-Doo) or a pirate party, fairy princess party, etc. Write down all your child's ideas on a sheet of paper, from theme to decorations, so you don't forget.
Get invitations.
Check your calendar to make sure you're not scheduling the party at the same time as your child's soccer game or piano lessons.
Make sure you write down the name of each guest invited, so you know how many chairs, how much food, goody bags, etc. that you will need.
Buy decorations.
If you go to a party store, they will have everything you need, and you won't have to go to five different stores for all your supplies.
At the party store, they even have goody bags, and toys to put in them.
Plan some games.
These are almost mandatory for children's parties, but you can substitute craft projects, or renting a bounce room or a clown.
(Look in your phone book for party rentals near you.)
Plan the party food.
Most importantly, you'll need to decide whether to buy a cake or make one (or two).
Make sure to get your order in on time or to shop for ingredients ahead of time so you can make the cake(s) the night before the party.
Decide what kind of food to have - some suggestions are pizzas (very easy to just have them delivered); finger sandwiches; lunch bags with a sandwich, small bag of chips and a party favor; or you can make large orders with a fast food restaurant for chicken nuggets or cheeseburgers or, of course, from a catering company.
If weather permits and you have a willing BBQ chef, kids love grilled hot dogs and hamburgers.
Don't forget the trimmings!
