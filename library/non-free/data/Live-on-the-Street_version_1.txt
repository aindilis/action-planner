death.Carry both a sleeping bag and sleeping pad suitable to the climate of the area in which you are living.
A combination sil poncho/tarp/bivy sack also comes in handy in rainy weather.
Sleep in a park during the day whenever possible; there is less chance of police harassment and mugging, it is generally warmer, and the grass makes a natural cushion.
Large parks, such as the Boston Common and San Diego's Balboa Park, make it easy to find a place to lay out your tarp and sleep for a few hours.
Beaches are also excellent places to sleep during the day, but keep above the high-tide line, unless you want to awake to the chill of an ocean wave, and wear sunscreen or keep your body covered.
If you must sleep on the street at night, find an area where the homeless are already doing the same.
You will be less conspicuous, and the police probably leave them alone in that area.
Be wary that the other homeless people may try to intimidate you or even rob you.
If you can't find a spot where the homeless are sleeping, choose a place that's fairly well lit yet out of the pedestrian walkway.
It's better to have the cops roust you than get mugged in a dark alley.
Another place to sleep relatively safely at night are rooftops of public buildings.
People do not naturally look up, and chances are you won't get found.
This may be classed as trespassing and illegal, however.
But it is safer than sleeping on the streets themselves.
Preferable rooftops are flat with alcoves or obstacles so you cannot roll off of the rooftop.
