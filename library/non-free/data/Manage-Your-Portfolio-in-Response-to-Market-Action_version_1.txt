levels.When investing in the stock market it is important to avoid "Putting your eggs in one basket".
That is, diversification in multiple different stocks is important to minimize the risk of a single investment having too much of an influence on your overall financial health.
A very interesting book that is well worth the read, is Robert Lichello's book : "How to Make $1,000,000 in the Stock Market---Automatically.".
He tries to have his portfolio shift back and forth between cash and equities automatically.
Track your investments all in one place . This way you can see the movement of your stocks.
Portfolio Managers like Mint.com and Wikinvest.com help you do that.
William O'Neill, of CANSLIM fame, the publisher of the Investor's Business Daily, and the author of "How to Make Money in Stocks" also believes in watching one's own portfolio, often if the market is doing poorly, then your own stocks will also be heavily affected and do poorly, possibly even hitting sale points on the downside.
When building your portfolio, start in "neutral" : half equities, and half cash.
That is, you need to predetermine the maximum number of stocks you wish to be managing.
Go for at least 12 stocks and up to maybe 24 or 25 positions.
Below that would not give enough diversification, and more than that would be difficult to manage.
Set your sale percentage at a loss.
For instance, you might want to sell all of your shares if they hit an 8% loss (as William O'Neil suggests), and also sell you positions if they go back to break-even after a first sale at a gain, or if they retrace 50% of the highest percentage gain if you have sold more than once.
The last is a bit confusing, but let it suffice to say that if you have sold 1/6 of a holding at a 90% gain, then if the stock retraces to a 45% gain, 1/2 of the top gain sale, then you would also sell all remaining shares.
Use these sales as signals for portfolio management : sales on 'bad news'; that is a drop in the price of a stock mean "caution", and sit on your hands with the money.
The only exception to this is if you are down to your minimum exposure in equities and you sell a stock, then you should plan on replacing the position with another stock.
What is the "minimum"?
Half of neutral.
That is if neutral for 24 positions is 12, then the minimum would be 6 positions with 75% of the value in cash.
Maximum is double the neutral position.
A sale on 'good news', that is on a targeted gain, is "good news" or a bullish sign meaning that it is safe to add a new position, moving your portfolio towards full investment.
