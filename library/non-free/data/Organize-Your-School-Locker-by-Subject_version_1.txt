timeClean out your locker.
Take out all of the things that you don't need anymore and only leave things that you still need for your classes, or things you use every day.
Cover your textbooks in different colored bookcovers, or if you are only allowed to cover them with brown paper bags, write the subject on the spine.
Put your papers from one subject into a binder that matches the color of the textbook cover of that subject.
Repeat for every subject.
Place your textbooks in order of your schedule on one shelf.
If you had a language arts class, a math class, then a science class as your schedule, this would be the order of your supplies.
Place your notebooks on the other shelf, also in order of your schedule.
