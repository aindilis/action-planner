ATTITUDE!Believe that you'll be able to stop your divorce.
So many people brush this step off as unnecessary, but the truth is that it's foundational to stopping your divorce.
The hard truth is that if you don't really believe in your heart that you can put a stop to your divorce and save your marriage, then it will be next to impossible to do so.
Explain to your spouse that you are committed to your marriage and that divorce is not an option ! Tell your spouse that not only do you want to stop your divorce and save your marriage, but that you want to build him (or her) up and be an encouragement in their life.
Also, don't be afraid to admit past mistakes to your spouse -- doing so will show them that you are serious about stopping your divorce.
