This is easy to do through the Kruger Park central reservations office.
Find out whether the camp you have booked in at has a restaurant, shop or is a bush camp with neither of these facilities.
If your camp does not have a shop or restaurant make sure you take food for your stay.
Buy a map of the Kruger Park so you can plan your route carefully.
Make sure your vehicle is full of fuel before you depart.
Pack the following : charcoal, firelighters, matches, corkscrew and bottle-opener & food and drink ( including alcohol!)
Take your own water as the water at the camps is not drinkable.
Pack your digital camera and the charger.
Take a pair of binoculars for each person and identification books !
Pack toiletries including loo roll !
Take torches as the camps are dark at night.

Several layers are a great idea as it is cod in the early morning but soon gets very hot.
Take a fleecey with you for the evenings as they can be cold during the South African winter months.
Wear strong boots if you intend to go on a walking safari with a guide.
Take a hat to keep your head cool and for use at sunset when the sun is very low in the sky.
