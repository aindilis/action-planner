fire"Evaluate which destinations are realistically within your cruising range.
Purchase a cruising guide for your area and reference it with your fuel usage and the average estimated travel speeds for the waterways in your area.
For example, the Intracoastal Waterway in Fort Lauderdale is loaded with no-wake zones and drawbridges.
That means slower traveling.
Confirm that food, fuel and dockage are available.
In many areas transient slips are limited and reservations are a must.
Brush up on your navigation by taking a refresher class.
Have your vessel s mechanics and electronics inspected to guarantee that your boat will make the trip.
Inspect your first-aid kit, PFDs ropes, ground tackle, waste holding tank (if so equipped), and fresh water supply.
Run through all you backup provisions (emergency food and water) and spare mechanicals (engine oil, coolant).
Have an extra engine key made if you haven t done so already.
Make sure that you have appropriate navigational charts.
Work on your float plan.
Similar to a pilot s flight plan, a float plan is a simple form that lists all the information about you and your vessel.
The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary offers a click-and-print plan at www.uscgaux.org/~floatplan.
Send the completed plan to anyone who is expecting your vessel at any stop on the itinerary, as well as any responsible family member not traveling with you.
Start checking the marine forecast 10 days in advance and be willing to abort if the weather is questionable.
What is the weather forecast?
Any local hazards or boating restrictions?
Do you have maps and charts?
Is all safety equipment aboard and in good order?
Ample reserves of fuel for the trip or will you need to refuel?
Is your VHF radio working properly?
First aid kit, basic tools and spare parts?
