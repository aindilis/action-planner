profit.Let s get started; open up your Outlook Express Address Book by clicking the icon for the address book.
Look down the list and find any email addresses that are no longer needed, <Select> them with a left mouse click and then click the <Delete> icon.
Alternate way <Right Mouse> click on any unused addresses and choose <Delete> from the drop down menu.
Repeat until all unused addresses are gone.
Recheck the list of email addresses and locate one where the email address appears in the Name field (column).
Double click on that email address and a Properties window will pop up.
Notice a number of tabs along the top starting with Summary then Name and Home.
Click on the <Name> tab and in the next window note the First name box is already in edit mode, just start typing in that box with a capital letter and the rest of the first name only, not the last name.
Next click in the Last name box (or Tab twice to get the flashing cursor there ) and input the last name of the contact there.
The email address will remain in the email box.
When the names are input properly click OK
Repeat for each email address that appears in the name field.
Now look for any entries where there is maybe only one name either last name or first name or misspelled or uncapitalized.
Double click on each and edit them as above until your address book looks a bit more professional.
Now to organize a bit further, let s say you have some names in your address book that you very seldom use but still want to keep them.
Another instance might be some contacts from a club, church or work that take up space in your address book and you seldom use them.
Here is how to group them in separate folders.
Open up the Address Book, click the mouse (select) Shared contacts , then click New> New folder in the box that comes up input an appropriate name for a group of emails that you want to keep together.
When done click OK and notice your new folder listed in the left panel.
