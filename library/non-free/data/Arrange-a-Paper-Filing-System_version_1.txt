DVD-R'sConsider the benefits of an alphabetical filing system.
An alphabetical filing system works well when you need to retrieve names of people, customers, authors, names of movies, books etc. Provided you use terms that are easy to retrieve, an alphabetical filing system is often the easiest system to use.
Use a topic order.
When you work or study in a variety of subject areas, a subject or topic order can be a very useful way to retrieve information.
For example, if you study law, you could have subject headings of contract, constitutional law, torts, administrative law, international law etc.
Use a frequency system.
This works really well for items that you use all the time.
It needs to feed off another system, for example the alphabetical system.
Add the frequently used information to a grouped space in your filing area so that it can be retrieved really quickly, such as at the very front of a filing cabinet drawer.
Try numerical filing.
This type of filing system is ideal for date or number filing.
For example, if you have invoices, receipts, dated events etc., the numerical system can make the easy to find again.
You can also consider month and year labeling for this option.
For those working in a environment that uses numbering for papers such as medical files, legislative documents, court cases, etc., numbering is a useful retrieval method.
