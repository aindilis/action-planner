fever)Eat Lots of fruits and vegetables ! Do this anyway but good foods always work wonders.
Oranges are especially important as many people find that a healthy dose of vitamin C found in oranges help fight off colds.
So don't forget to eat an orange each day or drink a cup of orange juice.
Take a daily multi-vitamin.
Vitamins will help you fight off colds by supporting your immune system.
Especially Vitamin C.
Get sunshine everyday and supplement with Vitamin D in the winter.
We make vitamin D when our skin is exposed to sunlight.
Just 15 mins of arms and face is enough to boost the immune system.
In winter when there is no sun we get colds because of this.
Supplement with tablets or cod liver oil October to March (Northern hemisphere).
Eat yogurt to help boost your good bacteria.
Drink a lot of water to prevent dryness from your nose or throat.
Water is good for you.
Try to drink at least eight cups of water each day.
Keep a bottle of liquid nearby for drinking whenever your throat starts drying out.
Once your throat drys and cracks open (from summer air conditioning, winter activities, or too much singing or talking), the bacteria that's already in your throat from previous infections will often reinfect you.
Sleep sitting up (with pillows supporting your back and neck) and your head slightly tilted forward, this is so that the mucus in your nose does not flow down your throat.
This is usually why you have a sore throat the next day and a cough later on dragging on the cold.
Sleep much longer than you normally do as you need the rest to regenerate.
Wash your hands before eating, before and after the bathroom, and use a paper towel to open the door of a public bathroom.
