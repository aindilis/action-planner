Should you change jobs?
Is this trip necessary?
Are you ready to change jobs?
How do you prepare yourself?
How easy or difficult would this be for you personally?
Will this be really tough?
How would you decide what directions are appropriate to who you are?
What are your options?
How would you begin to implement the change?
What 'baby steps' are consistent with your 'theory of victory'?
Recall your most enjoyable accomplishments and experiences, especially those that are deeply felt and emotionally fulfilling, and imagine venues, occasions and the means to do them again.
Keep a career journal/diary to collect all your positive thoughts, idea-associations, insights, and leads that occur to you as you recall your most enjoyable accomplishments and activities.
Affirm all of your skills, assets, and best attributes regularly, and remind yourself that with energy, optimism, and persistence you will find a place to use them.
Identify people you know (or better still, people who know people you know) who are doing what you think you might want to do; these people are targets for your information-gathering interviews.
Find out what the target' is like and don t like about their job/work/career, who else they know who does similar activities, and how they got there.
Scour their network of 1st, 2nd, 3rd generation of contacts (or degrees of separation) to glean information about -- and leads to -- others who may be doing what you d like to do.
Prepare one resume and one personal profile or one-page bio for each new career direction you wish to research or examine(up to a maximum of four).
Test drive job interviews to practice for the real thing first for jobs you don t necessarily want, and then for those you do want.
Volunteer, if necessary, to try out a job or career on for size, so you can see if it fits who you are.
