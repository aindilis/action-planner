Most cruise weddings take place in port.
This option is generally cheaper and less of a hassle than having the ceremony on the open seas.
If you decide to say your "I do's" onboard the cruise, speak to a representative from the cruise line of your choice as early as possible.
Some cruise companies, such as the Grand Princess, provide captains who will perform the service.
Other lines require that you "bring your own clergyman."
Keep in mind that while most do, not all cruise lines offer the option of getting married onboard (mostly because of inadequate space or limited staff).
Plan ahead.
When you speak to the representative, decide on a date & time, wedding packages, dining reservations, orchestras, invitations, rentals, etc. It's better to walk onto the ship for your wedding with everything already taken care of than having to scramble to arrange every detail onboard the ship.
Book your cabin and on-shore excursions as normal.
You'll be doing more on the cruise than getting married, so make sure everything is to your liking.
Register for a marrige license !
Confirm everything with the cruise line to make sure it's all the way you want it to be.
It doesn't hurt to call multiple times to double check everything you went over in step 4.
