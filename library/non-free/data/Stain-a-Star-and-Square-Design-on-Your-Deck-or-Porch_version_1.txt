you).Measure and mark the deck design.
This design consists of two easy-to-make shapes -- four triangles and one square.
These should be marked in proportion to the size of the deck or porch.
Use the straight edge and carpenter pencil to mark-off the designs on the deck.
Tape off.
Tape off the selected designs.
Stain.
Stain one color at a time.
The red deck stain covers the largest area of the deck.
Begin|]]
applying red to all the deck areas outside the taped-off sections.
Go back to tape.
Allow the red to dry before applying adjacent colors.
Check the label on your product for drying times.
Some latex stains dry to the touch in as little as two hours, other stains may require longer.
Remove the tape and re-tape the outside edges of the triangles and square to keep the color from bleeding onto the stain already applied.
Now apply the blue stain in the triangles with the small synthetic brush.
Get it squared away.
Since the middle square does not touch the blue triangle, begin applying white stain to the middle square.
Add the star.
Once the middle square is dry, tape down the star stencil in the middle.
Simply use a small, thin paint brush to fill in the star shape with blue stain.
Allow to dry.
