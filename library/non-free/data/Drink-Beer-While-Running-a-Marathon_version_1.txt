right?Picture at the finish line....
Train for the marathon as you normally would.
Avoid drinking a 12-pack of beer every day.
Save that for the day after your long run.
Switch to light beer during training.
Not only do you get to drink beer but you feel better about it as it doesn't contain as many calories as regular beer.
Purchase a running shirt (not cotton) and have some catchy beer drinking slogan or saying printed on it.
for example "I RUN FOR BEER".
This shirt is critical.
It lets people know that you mean business.
Other runners people out to cheer the runners on their way to the finish line will read your shirt and will yell all sorts of motivational slurs at you ! Some people will give you beers.
Bring money with you when you run just in case nobody gives you beer.
This way you can stop in many of the fine pub type establishments along the route for beverages.
Once the race has started, refrain from drinking beer for the first several miles.
Let your body get into the running rhythm before you start to feed it the elixir of life.
Remember to drink water in between beers.
