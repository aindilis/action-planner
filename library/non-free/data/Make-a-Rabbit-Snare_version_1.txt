rubberLocate an area where there are plenty of rabbits.
Look for droppings and holes.
Rabbits nearly always stay in the same area, so place your snare nearby.
Also, big brush piles work, so find the narrowest trail/entering and place it there.
Camouflage your snare.
Measure out about 2 ft and 5 inches of wire.
Fold 1 tip at about 1 and half inches, make a loop, and twist the rest of the wire about 5 times.
Push the other end through the loop and do step 2 to the second end.
