Turn on your favorite music or television show to help you wake up, but only if you know this won't distract you.
Get a cup of coffee or juice to help kick-start the morning.

Apply basic makeup.
It is important to be careful when applying, to avoid makeup lines and smears.
Look at your freshly washed face and cover any major flaws (i.e. acne, scars, rashes, bumps, or skin texture variations) with concealer.
The concealer should have a yellowish undertone to provide with the best coverage.
Cover the areas with a light blendable powder using a large brush.
If you want a professional look over a natural one, use a liquid foundation mixed with sunscreen and apply it with a brush to your skin.
Avoid using too much and make sure to blend it in to the hair line and jaw line well.
If you want a more natural look use bronzer or blush on your cheeks,nose and forehead to create the illusion of being sunkissed.
Prepare to add color.
Colored makeup.
Apply a small amount of mascara to elongate the eyelashes.
Use a neutral (i.e. plum shades, black, gray, or brown) liquid or stick eyeliner.
Apply by using small strokes in or outside the lash line.
Use 2-3 variations of one eyeshadow shade on the lid.
The lightest goes directly under the brow (brow bone).
Two shades can be mixed to put on the crease or a middle shade used.
The darkest is used on the actual lid.
Now is the lip color.
Find a color that compliments your skin tone- gloss or stick.
Carefully apply and put a clear gloss over.

For work, a nice neutral suit or pencil skirt with heels and a colored blouse.
For a date a somewhat revealing dress in a hot color with a peeptoe heel and delicate jewelry.
For a day trip with the girls a casual jean or khaki pant and a comfy shirt or cute cami under a structured jacket works.
Pair this with a hobo back chunky jewelry and a nice running shoe or ballet slipper.
