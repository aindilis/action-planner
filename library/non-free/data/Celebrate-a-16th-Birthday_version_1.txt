Follow the next steps in order to have a successful birthday party.
Go through your email contacts and Email everyone about your party.
Make sure you say where, when, and how long it will be for, or if you have an account on Facebook, Myspace, Youtube, or Bebo then you can send them a message saying it is your birthday.
Decorate the whole house; including outside with lots of banners and balloons.
Buy a cake.
Make sure you have 16 candles!
When everyone arrives, collect presents and cards and put them into a big bag or on a table.
Have a party inside.
When you're all out of breath (at about 10 :00pm), all snuggle up and watch a movie.
Now you have your energy back, go outside and have another party.
Keep the noise down after 11:00pm, as people may hear the party and phone the police.
Not the best way to be spending your sixteenth birthday in prison, is it?
Go back inside and do the cake.
Go up to your room and have a pillow fight.
When it's about 1 :00am, get ready to have a sleepover.
Invite a few friends, including your boyfriend/girlfriend (if you have one), and play games.
