glassesAssemble the equipment and tools needed for excavation (backhoe tractor, trencher, shovel, contractor's dummy level and rod, PVC perforated pipe, embedment material, PVC glue, PVC fittings, hand saw, course file).
Comply with state and county health regulations and obtain any required permits.
In some areas, this can include federal permits.
Part of the permit process will most likely include a test to determine the type and size of drainage field you may need for the system you are installing.
This test may be done by the local health inspector or an independent testing lab.
Again, this will depend on your local regulations.
Once permit is in hand your can begin installation of your system.
Plan for the flow to go down hill, as this is exactly what a gravity fed system is all about.
It does not use a mechanical means other than gravity to discharge the waste from the tank.
Also, it requires only a concrete aerobic divided tank and perforated pipe embedded in gravel.
Excavate a hole large enough to set the concrete aerobic tank below ground.
The tank normally comes in two pieces.
The bottom section shows the division of the tank.
The next section receives the effluent material from the house or building.
After the initial bacterial breakdown, the effluence flows into that second section where it breaks down further before it flows into your leech field.
Lay out and excavate your leech field as it has been determined by the test done in the permit process.
When laying out and excavating, remember to maintain a positive flow away from the tank.
Place either river or crushed stone around the pipe gravel.
This is required to hold the pipe steady.
See your local health requirements for the size of embedment needed and the size of gravel.
Install an aerobic septic system using the same type of holding tanks, but with the addition of electric pumps to agitate the effluent material and PVC sprinkler pipe instead of PVC perforated pipe.
Effluence is processed into the second tank and pumped off to a sprinkler system.
Set up the tank the same way as you would a gravity-fed tank.
Add effluent pumps and floats to turn on the sprinkler pump at timed intervals.
This is a sealed system, and the electrical installation will require a licensed electrician to satisfy the equipment warranty.
Begin with the installation of irrigation water lines (instead of perforated pipe) from the tank to the sites of the pop-up sprinkler heads.
These are located in the areas you have chosen to spray out the more highly treated waste water.
Establish the pop-up sprinklers far enough apart so the spray areas may touch but not overlap.
