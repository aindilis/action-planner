If you want to have full control over who sees your profile, meaning that only people you have chosen will be able to see any part of your profile, choose "Friends Only".
Towards the bottom of the settings, uncheck the box that say "Let friends of people tagged in my photos and posts see them".
Then click on "Apply These Settings".
If there are parts of your profile you don't want some of your Facebook friends to see (such as if you can't reject a friends request from your nosy Aunt Bertha, but you really don't want her seeing what your real friends see), choose "Custom" and click on "Customize Settings".
For every dropdown menu, choose "Customize".
For "Make this visible to" choose "Specific People" from the dropdown menu and type in the name of the friends who you want to be able to see this part of your profile.
Alternatively, choose who you want to lock out of that part of your profile by typing their names into "Hide this from".
If you can see yourself picking out the same groups of people for each part of your profile, see How to Make Friends Lists on Facebook and type in the name of the list instead.
Go back to the main privacy page and click on the "View Settings" link under "Basic Directory Information".
This controls who can find you, and what they can see if they do.
It also controls who can contact you.
Each setting has its own dropdown menu.
