disc.Get a plastic bag for garbage.
Start with a small area, like a closet or desk.
Spread everything that is in that area out on the floor or bed.
Make separate neat piles for things that you want to :
Throw away
Give away
Keep and use a lot
Keep but not use much
Move
Ask yourself a few questions, such as :
Do I really need this?
Can I give it to someone else?
How many times have I used this?
Have I worn or used this in the past year?
Does it still have a use?
Can I reuse it?
Throw all the stuff in the "Throw Away" pile out.
Give things in the "Give Away" pile to a shelter or organization.
Warning: Only do this if things are not too worn out or falling apart.
Store the things in the "Keep but not use much" pile in large containers.
Store these containers in miscellaneous location, such as at the bottom of a closet, under a bed, or in a basement.
Put stuff you want to "Display" on the wall, so that it is out of the way but still viewable.
Separate things you want to use a lot into categories.
For example, put all of your writing utensils in a cup.
Get rid of any objects you think you won't use anymore.
Move things in the "Move" pile to somewhere else in the room or house.
As you move those items, think carefully about whether you really need them or not.
If they don't belong in your room, do they belong anywhere else?
If not, throw it out or give it away.
Put your contained items into their appropriate place.
Again, look through them to see if you really need to use them.
Put the containers in appropriate locations, but still out of the immediate way.
For instance, put your writing utensils on a desk, but to the back or side of the desk top.
When storing items, remember to build up, not out.
Store things on shelves, instead of the center of the room.
