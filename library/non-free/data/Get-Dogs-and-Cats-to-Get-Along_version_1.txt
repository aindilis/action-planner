toysKeep the pets separate at first.
Begin by showing all your pets equal amounts of love, because animals, like people, get jealous when 'the new kid' gets more attention then them.
Alternate rooms in which you keep the animals, so they can sniff where each other has been without the other animal being present.
Place the smaller animal in a crate for safety and allow the larger animal to sniff all around it.
Repeat this in 10-20 minute increments for a few days.
