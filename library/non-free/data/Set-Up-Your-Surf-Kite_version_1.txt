instructor.Inflate the kite.
Take your kite out of the bag, unwrap it and lay it out flat on the ground.
Put your board on one tip to stop it from blowing away.
Secure all of the valves on the kite and begin to inflate it!
Attach the lines.
Unroll your lines from your bar down wind and lay them on the ground.
Next, grab your 2 centre lines and walk up to the kite, making sure there's no tangles or knots in them.
The outside lines on the bar always attach to the back of the kite.
Attach your lines to the kite using a larks head knot remembering that the closer the knot to the kite the more power the kite will have in the air.
Note that beginners should attach their lines to the knots in the middle of the rope.
Attach the harness.
Now you are ready to attach your harness.
Wrap this around your back and close the two flaps across your stomach.
Next, secure the buckle and pull the fastening tight to make sure there is no movement.
Pull the bottom straps as tight as you can to stop the middle bar rising.
Pick up your bar and make sure the loop is facing you with the strap at the bottom.
Hook the loop over the bar on your harness and thread the strap through the bar below the loop.
Finally, fasten your leash on the harness to the leash point on the bar to act as your safety system should you come off your board.
