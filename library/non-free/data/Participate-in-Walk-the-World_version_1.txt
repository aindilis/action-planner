happiness.Practise walking . You are going to walk 5 kilometers, so you should try to practice a lot.
Walking a few metres every day will help, and so will jogging, running or any other form of exercise where you have to use 2 feet.
Collect money.
The whole point of Walk the World is to raise money to send to poor countries for food, so you might want to get a few sponsors.
They're not asking for a thousand dollars - although that would be very helpful - but they are asking for, let's say, five or six dollars.
Try to get many sponsors, that way you can raise more money.
Look for schools.
Some schools actually host their own little "Walk the World", so if you are a student, teacher, or parent, and your school's hosting a Walk the World, what are you waiting for?
Run to those sign-up sheets!
