patient.Feel Good.
Make sure you feel good after you organize or re-organize your home.
Associating good feelings with the organizing process will make maintenance easier.
Put things back in their home.
You've established homes for everything in your house.
So when you're done using something, put it back where it came from.
Regular, Light Maintenance.
Take 15 to 30 minutes at the end of the day to do a general sweep of your home, making sure that surfaces are clutter free and things are in their proper place.
Better 15 minutes a day, than 4-5 hours straight on some later date.
Be aware.
As you do your 15-minute sweeps, keep in mind what organization systems are working for you and which ones aren't.
Keep these in mind for action steps, later.
Re-Organize.
When you notice clutter building up in one area constantly or an organization system (filing, storing, etc) doesn't work quite how you'd hoped, schedule a time to re-think and implement a new system of organization.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Don't spend time on systems that are working just find.
If your closet works for you, let it be.
Take time to appreciate your home.
Sometimes we take it for granted.
If you really love your environment, you'll be more inclined to care for it.
It might seem obvious, but a lot of times we forget what we have in our lives.
