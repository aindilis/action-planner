bordersStay calm or freak out ahead of time.
But when that fateful day arrives, the first day in a foreign school, act as if this is what you do everyday.
Scream and pound your fists in your head and curse the heck out of everyone, in your head, but play it cool.
Remember, everyone around you is wondering how they would react to this situation, and it impresses them to see you so collected.
Evaluate other people.
There are always some kids who want to be the first to know the new kid, to veto them or accept them.
It's usually the popular ones.
The great thing about a new school is that they don't know the first thing about you!
So, watch them, and either laugh at them (this always helps in a pinch) or mold to them.
They are actually usually nicer to you than the other kids.
Beware of the opposite sex, especially if you're a girl and especially in France.
They can get pretty crude, and don't take no for an answer.
Just brush them off if you need to.
Getting flustered does NOT help.
Use lots of sign language.
Point at things and make funny faces.
If you can make people laugh while making them understand, you get even more points!
Talk.
Talk.
Talk.
Talk.
Not just with teachers when they ask you a question, but with all the kids, whether you like them or not.
They will be so busy trying to understand you that they won't notice how weird you speak.
And if anyone makes fun of how you talk, other people will get mad at them, seeing how much you try.
