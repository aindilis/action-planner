community.Wait for God to make it clear that this is the path He has for you.
Like Uzzah in 2 Samuel 6, reaching forth and grabbing the Arc of the Covenant (he died instantly), many people reach for a postion of ministry.
Wait and see, pray for confirmation.
Remember, this is God's Bride you are seeking to serve, be humble and remember your place.
Love God, be His Bride, be captivated by His goodness and develop a conversational relationship with Him.
He loves you!
Think hard about what you really want to be.
Is this really the job you want?
Do you want to do something else or become involved in ministry?
If you answered yes to the questions in step 2, pray to God to help you find the right path for you if you are lost.
Talk to your pastor, priest, or rabbi to see what they had to go through to get to where they are today and decide if that's what you want to do.
Talk to your Youth Director, Youth Pastor, or any other person involved in your church about ministry.
Chances are they will become very intersted in your interests and take you seriously.
If God leads, after graduating high school, go to college to get the proper degrees to become a pastor, priest, or rabbi.
If God leads, after college, attend a theological seminary.
This is where you will be ordained into ministry.
Remember, there was no theological seminary in the time of Christ, follow that path if God leads.
