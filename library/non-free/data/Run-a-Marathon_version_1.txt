journey.Achieve a base fitness level.
If you can't run, walk, bike, or do some other aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes at a time, you should work up to this first before attempting a marathon.
Get committed.
Choosing which marathon you want to run is one of the best ways to do this.
Not only do you turn your general plan (running a marathon) into a specific one (running the New York City Marathon on November 5th), but once you've invested the registration fee (typically between $40-$100) you have extra financial incentive to run it, too!
Find a buddy to do it with.
You'll motivate each other.
Pick a training plan that suits you.
This is possibly the most important step.
Training plans range all the way from ones that ask you to run three days a week to ones that require seven days a week of training, and can begin with 2 and 3 mile or 10 mile runs.
There are some good ones online; take the time to look around for one that suits your schedule and your fitness level.
Stick with your training plan.
It may seem monotonous to run day after day after day.
You might not be able to fit in a run one day, or you might get sick or injured.
It's fine to miss a day or shorten a run every once in a while, but the important thing is to get back out there as soon as you can.
Marathon training is a long, slow process, but it's the only way to reach your goal.
