calendar.Make a journal of concerns you have regarding your health, note if they are ongoing, happens when you are stressed, any details you think of.
The journal will be a way to remember what to talk to the doctor about, bring it with you each time you go to the doctor.
Each time you see your doctor, even for something unrelated, you can discuss other issues also.
When scheduling an appointment like this tells the person you are scheduling it with that you would like an extended visit to discuss multiple issues.
This will allow for more time with your doctor, for the same co-pay.
Wait for at least 72 hours before seeing the doctor if the reason for seeking medical treatment is viral.
The only exception would be if you have a temperature over 104, or if you cannot touch your chin to your chest (this could be meningitis).
Don't wait if it is an infection.
If the reason for seeking medical treatment is a recurring problem that needs antibiotic treatment, call the doctor directly and discuss it with him.
He may call you in a prescription without going in to the office.
Put a message through to your doctor when you need medical advice.
The doctor is more likely to only have you seen if needed.
