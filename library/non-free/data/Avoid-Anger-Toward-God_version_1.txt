addressExamine whether or to what extent members of the human race are free moral (amoral or immoral) agents.
Should God intervene : in nature, things and man's evil, cruelty and hate?
Should God interfere and make you/others into a robot : in your choices, man's right or wrong choices whether robbing, speeding or being careless.
Examine God's love and provisions for mankind to :
Have intelligent ability, opportunity to acquire and to give, choose good or bad things and activities that may help or cause pain...
Accept dismay about events of any kinds which are natural or predestined, forced or controlled( ?).
Consider whether people are at the wrong place at the wrong time, and whether individuals are yielded or not to do good or to do evil.
Evil happens, true or false?
Are you free to choose?
Avoid overplaying dismal events in which you might wish that God would have exhibited his overwhelming power :
Consider whether man is under free will and whether or not most of disability, poverty, taking advantage, rejecting good choices/choosing poorly, are based on human traits, choices, and failings.
Consider the impact of weaknesses/strengths, evil/goodness, cruelty/mercy, war/peace, poverty/sufficiency, hatred/acceptance, fear/courage and apathy (or hate)/caring (love).
Raise your ideals to give other persons a right to be angry, but moderate your opinions and so avoid grudges and spite.
Deal with anger related to views of real and potential events to prevent hating God for not interfering.
