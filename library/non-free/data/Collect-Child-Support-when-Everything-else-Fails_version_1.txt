run.Go into the court yourself, and ask for a "Complaint for Contempt".
If you do not know the non-custodials address, ask your child support enforcement to serve the papers.
Be specific ! How long has the noncustodial parent not paid?
How much is owed in past due support?
Know the last date of payment, and be specific on what you are seeking!
On the date you appear, you will meet with a "mediator."
If you do not have an attorney, be cautious about entering into any agreements!
The non-custodial parent-if evading paying child support, will most likely fail to comply with the agreement.
If you do enter into an agreement, you will probably do nothing further.
If you refuse, and it is your right to refuse to enter into an agreement, be very specific about the action you would like the court to take.
This will usually be to enforce your order to pay child support.
If the judge gives time for the parent to pay, ask for a suspended sentence.
If the other parent doesn't pay, they will face jail time.
