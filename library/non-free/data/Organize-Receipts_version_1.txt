awayOn a legal pad, make a list of categories and subcategories for your receipts.
Suggestions for categories can be easily adapted from programs such as Quicken or MSMoney
Purchase inexpensive file folders for each main category.
Label the tab of the folder with the name of the main category.
On the front face of the folder, write the subcategories that will be contained in that folder.
Sort folders alphabetically by category.
Start at the top of your unsorted pile and handle each receipt only once.
As you sort through the receipts, look at the date first and remove any that are not for the current year.
You should use a different set of files for different tax years.
Determine the most appropriate category or subcategory that would apply to the receipt.
Place receipt in the corresponding folder.
If you discover new categories, add new folders.
If you discover new subcategories, write them on the front of the category folder.
