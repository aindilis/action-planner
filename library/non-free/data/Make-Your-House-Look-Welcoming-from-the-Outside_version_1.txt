environmentWhere is the entrance?
Make sure your entrance is accessible.
That means cleaning up the front yard , porch and entrance-way to allow visitors to get to the front door without stepping through or over obstacles.
Clean up the walk from the street, sidewalk, or driveway.
Remove brush, thorny plants, overhanging branches, toys, or other hazards.
Make sure the walkway path itself is usable- try to have cement, flagstones , gravel , or even a wooden walkway so people aren't stepping in water, snow or mud.
A clear entry-way
Have a clear access path to the door.
When visitors approach from the street, drive or other public area, can they see which way to walk?
They must be able to open the gate, for example.
An archway, trellis , or other landscape feature is a good way to announce the entrance.
This isn't very interesting.
Add decorative features on the walkway or near the entrance.
These could include potted plants, benches , paving stones, planter boxes, signs, statuary, bird baths, fountains , flowers, artwork, or decorative plants.
A nice doorway
At the front door, add features to make it look like a home.
You might have a small chair and table, a bowl of rocks or shells, a potted plant, a sign, a place for shoes or boots, an umbrella stand, hooks for hats or wet clothes, a brush for muddy shoes, a bin for walking sticks or canes, or some shade for hot days.
A friendly greeting
Don't allow obstacles at the front door.
Don't make visitors step over a pile of shoes, the family dog, children's toys, or other things on the floor to get inside.
This isn't welcoming.
