you.First, the best build is a Chinese spear character.
Make sure with a spear you choose armor, not protector or garment/robe.
When you make your character, go out and kill some Mangyangs until level 2.
When you are at that point, you will want to add all points to Str.
You will also find that there are many masteries to choose from.
The ones you need to level up are Lightning, Force, and Heuskal.
Now that you are level 2, you want to move on to Small-Eyed Ghosts.
Kill those until you reach level 3.
Again, level up Lightning, Force, and Heuksal, along with adding all points to Str.
Now it is time to kill Old Weasals.
They may be one level higher than you, but you can level up faster.
Kill a few then rest, and so on...
When you reach level 4 go and kill regular Weasals.
They will bring you to level 5.
Now go to the Water Ghosts and kill them until level 7.
Once level 7, you will now want to kill creatures in the order I list them.
Broken Stone Ghost, Stone Ghost, Yeoha (Decayed & Normal), Young Tiger, Tiger, Black Tiger, White Tiger, and Chakji Warriors.
(When you kill Yeohas, watch out for the Party monsters.
They will have a blue icon before their name.
I recommend that you don't kill them.
They may look easy to kill but their strength and health are higher than the normals'.
Their health is eight times more and they hit twice as hard.
Try killing these when you are level 16 and above.
