spearhead(optional)First cut some fishing line to the right depth you will be fishing.
Slide the float on the line.
Put the rubbers onto the stem of the float.
You should put 3 rubbers onto the stem all spaced out.
The rubbers are used to hold the float on.
After that, tie a loop at the top of the line.
This is to attach the rig to your pole.
If you are using a hook length, you may want to tie a loop at the other side of the line, then link your hook length to the line.
Attach your hook length/hook to the main line.
Shoot your rig to your float's recommended shooting pattern.
