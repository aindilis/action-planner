rest.Don't panic ! Keep control movements moderate and gentle.
Try to keep the airplane straight and level.
If you can, try to fly the plane to where you can land on grass or a runway.
Decide whether a normal landing is possible.
If yes, set up for a descent and land your airplane.
If you cannot make a normal landing, find a safe spot for an emergency landing.
Keep turns wide and do not overcontrol the pitch of the aircraft; you may cause a stall and crash.
If the engine has quit or you have no motor power, keep glide speed high enough to maintain control of the airplane.
Descend as expeditiously as possible and set the airplane down.
Make sure your throttle switch or motor control is in the "off" position once the airplane is on the ground.
