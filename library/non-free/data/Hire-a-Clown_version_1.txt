bitCreate a list of local clowns.
Ask other friends who have hired a clown about how their performance was, and if the clown acted appropriately and was reasonably entertaining.
Call up clowns that meet your kids' area of interest and ask them about the typical age-group of the audience, length of the show and what a typical entertainment routine looks like.
Perform a background check on all of the performers you are planning on hiring.
Schedule an interview with this performer.
Closely observe his behavior and manner of speaking.
Does this man seem normal to you?
If you notice that he avoids eye contact and/or has an intense stare when he looks at you or your child, cancel his services immediately.
Similarly, never hire someone who comes to the interview in their clown costume and makeup.
Naturally, you'll also want to see that his fingertips are still intact; if his finger tips look very smooth, it is likely he has erased his fingerprints for some reason or another.
Contact his references and family members.
Do they seem normal?
Red flags include living in a mobile home, having alcoholic or excessively creepy fathers, small hands, smell of pickles, or if it looks like they have recently had some landscaping work done.
Find out what his rates are, and come to an agreement about payment.
Book early - popular entertainers are booked at least a month in advance - late summer and fall are the busiest.
Ensure that you have a contract.
