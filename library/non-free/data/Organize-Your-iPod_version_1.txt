friends!!determination.Put all songs by the same artist under one name, preferably with the correct spelling.
Go to iTunes and right click on the song and select get info ( or for Mac Users press Apple + I).
Type in the correct artist name and other other info.
If you're editing multiple songs by the same artist, click the first song, then hold down CTRL (or Apple) and click the others by that artist.
Right-click one of them and select get info (or press Apple + I), just as you usually would.
iTunes will ask for confirmation to edit multiple songs' info; click continue.
Do not settle for untitled batches of tracks.
Find out their names.
Put songs performed by a main artist and assisted by a featured artist under the main artist only.
Put the main artist in the artist section and after the song list the second artist's name as a featuring credit.
Originally in iTunes: Name: Song, Artist: John Doe & Jane Doe
In this way: Name: Song (feat.
Jane Doe), Artist: John Doe
Make sure album titles are the same and correctly-spelled throughout the album.
Add album artwork to the album if you wish.
Find out the original albums of songs in "Greatest Hits".
This way you will not have two pointless albums; one for an original song and one from a "Greatest Hits" album.
Put any soundtracks in the genre "Soundtrack" for easy access.
You can even subdivide further and put "Movie Soundtrack", "Broadway Cast Recordings", "TV Show Soundtrack", etc. Don't worry about most other genre classifications however (Rock, Pop, Indie).
It takes even longer to edit those and it's not really worth it.
Click on the "Time" tab at the top of iTunes to organize your music by time.
Go through and find duplicate songs.
Also, you can click File at the very top and select "Show Duplicates".
