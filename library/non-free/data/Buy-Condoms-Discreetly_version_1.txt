space.Figure out what type of condom you are going to purchase before beginning your mission.
Don't be shy in preparing yourself before going to the store.
Approach the store nonchalantly, perhaps in a group of friends.
Be casual and act as if it is regular and not out of place for you to be buying a condom.
Have your research finished before you get into the store.
Walk discreetly up to the condom shelves.
Grab what you are looking for and walk calmly to the checkout counter.
While not necessary, you might feel more comfortable if you buy a few more things so you are not standing at the counter with nothing but a box of condoms.
Tie a knot around the top of the bag with the handles so if you drop the bag the contents won't go flying out.
