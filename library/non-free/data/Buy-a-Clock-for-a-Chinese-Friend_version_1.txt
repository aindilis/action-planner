playersAvoid giving a clock as a surprise gift.
Make your recipients know in advance when you're going to give them a clock.
If they are hesitant in their response, choose another gift.
Adjust your gift giving tactic for those interested in clocks.
For example, if your gift recipient is an antique clock collector, then avoid "giving" a clock as a "gift".
Ask if they would like to buy the clock for $1.
Give something more than just a clock.
You may buy a multi-function clock, with an electronic organizer, calculator, dictionary, etc. Avoid describing it as a clock; instead, name its other functions.
As with other clocks, don't give it as a surprise gift.
