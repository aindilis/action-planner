CoverWash and wax exterior of your car.
If you don't clean and protect the paint, any dirt or contaminants left on the car will corrode the paint, and turn into rust.
Clean and vacuum interior.
Again, dirt and debris can cause damage if left to sit for an extended period of time.
Top off fluids.
A full fluid reservoir will leave no space for condensation to occur.
Change oil and filter.
Old oil will become acidic and eat away at the inside of your engine.
However, fresh oil will take much longer to break down.
So, your engine seals should remain in good condition throughout the storage.
Grease steering and suspension components.
A full grease service will keep the seals, and rubber bushings in your suspension from drying out while the car's in storage.
Disconnect battery (for older vehicles).
If your battery is left connected, its charge will completely deplete, causing one or more of the inner cells to go bad.
Place battery on a trickle charger (newer vehicles that require a constant source of power).
Most newer vehicles are equipped with advanced computer systems, which require constant power.
Otherwise, they'll have to be completely reprogrammed.
Top off fuel tank and add fuel stabilizer.
A full tank means that there's less room for condensation, and a stabilizer will keep the gas from breaking down and evaporating.
