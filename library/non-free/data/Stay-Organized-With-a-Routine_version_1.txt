calendarPencilDeterminationMake a routine.
Make a checklist.
First start with things like "Get up at 7:10am and eat breakfast" and etc. Plan your day so you get used to it first.
Get more advanced after becoming accustomed to that system.
Checklists are a good way to start a routine.
Mix things up, add things, or take away things to change a routine.Try your routine for a few days and if you don't like it change it!
Stay organized.Clean up once a week(this includes your room,updating your planner ect.)
