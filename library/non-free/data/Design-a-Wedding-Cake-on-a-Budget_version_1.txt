partner!Get your hands on free wedding cake catalogs.
This can be difficult sometimes because local bakery shops usually have their own styles and one-of-a-kind cake designs.
Sometimes your best bet is to look up wedding cake galleries online and then take a design you find online (printed out) to your local bakery.
Look at magazines of cakes and even books that focus on cake decorating.
These are another great source of ideas.
If you can't afford the wedding magazines and books, there are many ways to find them without having to spend a lot of money.
Go the library or a bookstore and look through designs.
Look in thrift stores; wedding magazines are often available for next-to-nothing once other people's weddings are done!
Have a budget in mind before you go to the local bakery shop.
This way you won't get in over your head and buy too much cake.
To help you get a budget in mind, you will need an accurate head-count of the number of guests so you know how much cake to buy.
