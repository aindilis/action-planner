calendar.Make your profiles private.
In MySpace, you can make your entire profile private, so that no one can see anything but your profile picture, and your mood underneath it.
There is also an option to make your main profile page visible to the public, but everything else (albums, status history, comments, calendar, etc.) private.
In Facebook, check your settings.
If your primary network is the city you live in, and people in your network can see your profile, that means everyone in your city has access to your profile.
Protect your Twitter updates so that no one can read them unless you approve.
Make any online photo albums private, too, especially if you embed pictures from those albums onto your social media profiles.
Upload small pictures.
There are people out there who will download pictures of you onto their computer and pore over them.
Even if your profiles are private, people can find the original version of your profile picture or avatar (the high resolution one) and download it.
So when you upload pictures, make them a low enough resolution that if a creep does get their hands on them, they can't zoom in.
Besides, who really needs to see a picture of you that's any wider or taller than 200 pixels?
Avoid tagging in photos.
Don't tag others, and don't allow others to tag you.
Once you link to someone else's profile through tagging, big privacy holes open up.
For example, if you are tagged in your aunt's Facebook album, and her Facebook page is private, people can still access that album if they have the right link, unless your aunt went out of her way to make the album itself private.
They'll see any other pictures of you or your family or your friends, and they'll also see the comments you left (and the comments people left about you).
