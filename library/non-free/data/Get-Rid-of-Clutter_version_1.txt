sellersMake a pile of all the things you don't need (ways to sort through the things you don't need are listed below).
Place this pile in a large, clean area so that you can see everything and organize it (6-10)
Sort through the items you have either outgrown or no longer use.
Be brutal.
If it clutters up the room, put it in the pile.
After all, do you really need those magazines which you have collected since 1998, but have rarely read?
Empty your closet/drawers.
Take all the clothes which don't fit, and give them to charity.
Take all the pieces of paper you have lieing around, and throw away the ones you don't need.
Store the rest in organized folders
Any place that attracts clutter, such as your bed, clean it, and remove all the items in this area.
Throw away items you don't need, clean dirty ones, and put everything else back where it belongs.
Divide your large pile into three sub-piles.
First pile : Pile number one should be the things that you mostly use on a daily basis.
For example, your phone,tools, shoes, and so on.
For keys, perhaps place them in a bowl near the door, keep tools in a tool box, or buy a shoe organizer.
Whatever works for you and will help you find all the more important items easily.
Second pile : Pile number two should include the things that you use at least once a week or once a month.
These are the items that belong in closets, garages or other places that are out of the way.
Organize these into storage containers (preferably clear ones so you can easily see their contents) and label them.
Other items, such as clothes, hang on clothes hangers and put them away.
Third pile : Pile number three should include the things that you have not used for at least six months or a year.
If you have not used them in a year, chances are you may never do so.
Therefore,get rid of them.
Give unused and unwanted items to charity, so that someone less fortunate can use them.
