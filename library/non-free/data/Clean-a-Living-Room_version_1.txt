furniture!Clear the clutter.
Start by removing and recycling or discarding anything that is plainly trash.
This gives you a visible start, and it gets the first part done quickly.
Put away any items that don't belong in the living room.
You can either put this stuff away directly or gather it in a box or laundry basket and put it away all at once.
If you do collect it first, make sure it gets put away.
Remember as you go that any clutter you discard at this point is stuff you never have to tidy, or dust, again.
If time is short, a full review of the clutter might have to wait until later.
Use a vacuum hose or broom to remove cobwebs from ceilings and dust from ceiling fan or light fixtures.
Do this before cleaning the floor or anything underneath these areas.
Clean the couches and chairs in the room.
Use the long stick attached to the vacuum to remove crumbs, dust, and lint from upholstered furniture.
Shelve books, CDs, and DVDs neatly.
Use a wet rag and cleaning solution, wipe down the tables, desks, the TV, blinds and window seal as well as patio door.
Use an appropriate wood cleaner on wood furniture.
If things just need to be dusted, use a duster, dust cloth, or vacuum hose attachment to dust the surfaces.
You need not get something wet just to remove dust.
Straighten anything on tables and shelves.
Also reposition sofa cushions, throw pillows, and scatter rugs that have slid out of position.
Re-fold any blankets that hang over the back of sofas or chairs.
Dust or vacuum the baseboards, if they need it.
Sweep and damp-mop the floor, if it is hard, and vacuum any rugs or carpet in the room.
If it is safe to do so, open windows to air out the room.
Spot clean any spots in the carpet.
