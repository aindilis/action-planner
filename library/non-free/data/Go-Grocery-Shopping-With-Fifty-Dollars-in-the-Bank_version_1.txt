job.Know what you need.
Make a detailed list, organized by the area of the store you will find the item (produce, deli, meats, dairy, frozen, grocery, etc.).
You can customize the list to fit the aisles at your usual store and save a lot of time.
This will also keep you from impulse shopping as you can just grab and go with most items.
Buy only the items on your list!
Look at your list again to make sure you haven't put any extra items you don't really need.
Shop at a low cost grocery store or discount outlet.
Buy only the necessities for your home.
This means food (no specialty items), and toilet paper.
Allow yourself few, if any, luxuries.
Use Coupons as they are an excellent way to save money on certain items.
Make sure that the coupons that you have can be used in the store of your choice.
Mark your list with a "c" or other symbol to remind yourself that you have a coupon for that item.
Be sure to allocate a few extra dollars for taxes.
(Unless you live in a state without food taxes)
