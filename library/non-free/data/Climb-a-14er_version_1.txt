cold.Prepare your route.
Make sure the trail you plan to follow is within your hiking and endurance capabilities.
Check the weather report for the day you plan to hike.
Try to be off the peak as early as possible to avoid afternoon thunderstorms and lightning.
Gather all your supplies the day before you attempt the climb.
You may be trying to summit in one day or take a multi-day backpacking trip.
Either way, ensure you have proper equipment and survival gear.
Notify someone of your trip and estimated time of return.
Provide specifics including: vehicle make, model and license number; who you are traveling with; trailhead; and planned route.
Leave early to give yourself enough time to complete the trip and avoid hazardous weather.
Lightning is especially hazardous above treeline.
Storms have a greater chance of forming in the afternoon.
Plan to descend below treeline as early in the day as possible.
When hiking, try to keep a steady pace.
Don't rush at the start and be sure to give yourself enough water breaks.
Above 12,000' (or lower if you're not acclimated) stop and rest for a few minutes if you feel lightheaded.
The lightheadedness is from a lack of oxygen to your brain.
Resting will make more blood available for your noggin'.
Enjoy the view at the top and sign the logbook (if available) as a record of your success.
Observe the weather and return to tree line before hazardous weather approaches.
Keep a steady pace on the descent.
Be careful not to run and trip.
The downward hike is often more strenuous on the legs and feet than hiking uphill.
Return to the trail head before dark, or be sure to carry a flashlight or headlamp.
