useful.Plan ahead.
Set the date and place.
Decide on the guest list, and invite them.
Figure out what to serve in the way of the food and drinks, and make arrangements.
Set up the music for the party, and arrange it so that you will not be distracted from being a good host/ess by the need to tend to the music.
Make sure that the place is tidy and functional (i.e., that people can circulate, sit down when they need to, and use the washroom and other facilities.
Develop a theme and encourage your guests to dress according to the theme.
Alternatively forget about the theme and blast the music in a big variety and just have fun with it.
