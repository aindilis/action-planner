fine.Think of where you're going and what you'll be doing.
For example-tenting in the woods on a lake or staying at a campsite with lots of other people.
Search for suggested packing lists on the internet.
Prioritize.
Since you'll be swimming almost all day,every day, swimsuits are a must.
Bring a few so there will always be a dry one.
Think of your head, your body, and your feet.
All of these will need to be covered.
Pack for the weather.
If it's going to be 20+ degrees, you probably only need one long-sleeved shirt and maybe a pair of sweatpants.
It can cool off at night, however.
Think of all scenarios.
Don't forget your rain-gear!
Cram it all into the smallest pack possible.
Don't pack anything you wouldn't mind getting dirty, wet and wrinkled to no end.
