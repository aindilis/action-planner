confirmationOnce you have purchased your basic AT gear set up (skis, AT bindings, and climbing skins) the first step is to cut the skins to size.
To cut the skins to size, place the wire loop over the tip of the ski, tightly pull the skins down along the ski, making sure the adhesive attaches to the base smoothly.
Run the included razor down the skins, cutting them to the contour of your ski's edge.
Repeat on the other ski.
Remember, some skis have different shapes from right to left, so make sure to mark your skis accordingly so they match up perfectly every time you put them on.
Understand the installation process.
Each time you put the skins on, put the wire over the tip and pull the skins down tightly, ensuring that the skins are sitting flat on the ski, the final step is to clamp the end of the skin down on to the tail of the ski.
To store your skins, peel the adhesive off of your ski's base.
Fold your skins into thirds, keeping the adhesive side inward.
