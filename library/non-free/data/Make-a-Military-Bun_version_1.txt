Prior to making the military bun, you'll need to prepare your hair as follows:
Brush and thoroughly untangle you hair prior to washing.
Do this before washing because brushing wet hair can cause the hairs to break and weaken.
Wash your hair.
If you wish, you can shampoo and condition, but the main purpose here of washing is to get your hair wet.
Don't dry your hair!
Hair should be damp, but if your hair is excessively wet, wring it out.
Comb your hair gently to get all the bumps out.
Put a dime-size amount of hair gel onto the comb and run it through your hair.
Center of the back of the head
Take a ponytail holder and make a ponytail in the middle of the back of your head.
Wrap the holder 3-4 times around; the ponytail should be very tight and close to your scalp.
Wrap a second ponytail holder around the ponytail, in case the first one breaks or loses its elasticity.
Twisting the ponytail
Grab the ponytail and twist it, as shown in the image accompanying this step.
Wrapping the bun
Staring at the base of the ponytail, wrap the hair about itself tightly, as shown in the image accompanying this step.
Inserting the pins
Secure with 2-3 large bobby pins at the top of the bun, pushing the pin down to secure the bun to the rest of your hair.
Put a hairnet over the whole bun, doubling it twice or three times, depending on bun size.
Secure with 2-3 small bobby pins.
