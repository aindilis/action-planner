Fast small ones include Xnview (open source) and Irfanview (popular).
Picasa from Google is an easy-to-use photo management tool.
However, read the fine print on the agreement you sign with Picasa/Google.
It gives Google the rights to all of the photos you put on the site, for their unrestricted use.
When you transfer your photos from your camera to your computer, immediately put them into a folder on your hard drive -- not just My Pictures, but create a subfolder by date (use reverse date format e.g. 2007-06-26 which is listed better by computers ordering files by name), event name or both.
If you already have copious numbers of photos dumped into your My Pictures folder, take some time to create subfolders as described above, and sort them into the appropriate folder.
Regularly back up your photos by burning them onto a CD or DVD.
Nothing is worse than having a hard drive crash and losing all of your pictures.
Then, put your CD or DVD into a box, holder, or album (you can find 'photo albums' for picture CDs in photography shops) so you know where it is and have easy access.
As soon as the ink is dry, organize your photos into albums.
The sooner you do this, the fewer photos you will have piling up and cluttering your space, not to mention getting damaged.
Do the above step for all of the photos you already have printed out.
Use different albums to catalogue and categorize -- for example, you can keep separate albums for friends, events you attend, and 'artful' shots that you take.
Remember that if you back up your photos onto a CD, and leave them on the computer as well, you will eventually find you have multiple copies of the same photo in different folders.
In Picasa2, when you back up pictures, Picasa will remember not to double up on the same CD.
