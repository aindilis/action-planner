it.Plan ahead.
This is a road trip, and will involve some cost.
However, you can make it as cheap or as expensive as you like, depending on accommodations, food, etc. Research your spot you are going to go ahead of time you will be glad you did.
Make a list of about 10-15 places you want to visit.
It's easier if you make the list so that you stop in places that circle around the whole country or region you will be traveling in.
If you want to pick your trip spot in a creative way print out a map of the United states or a map of the world and get a thumb tack.
Put the map on the wall, put a blindfold on a family member spin them around 3 times and have them place the tack on the map, where the tack is placed will be your final destination.
When you get a destination plan your trip from where you live to where the tack was placed.
Decide exactly where you're going to be and also how long you're going to stay there.
(i.e. Atlanta, Georgia 2 days)
Make sure you and your travel companions can all get time off.
Go online to different trip planning websites made for road travel that allow you to plan based on WHO you are traveling with, WHAT you like to do (even if you don't know WHERE you are going or WHEN) and lastly that allow you to state HOW you want to travel (e.g. how many miles per day, freeways or avoid freeways).
These sites let you browse Places to Stay, Places to Eat, Places to Go, Things to Do, Places to Shop and Things you Need along the way.
They also let you book hotels or rent a car for your road trip.
Alternatively, you can plan everything manually and then just go to an online site ( http ://www.expedia.com ) to book different hotels at the best price you can get them.
Alternatively, you can stop at motels or hostels along the way.
Once the day comes bring all of your bags and have a very fun and exciting vacation.
