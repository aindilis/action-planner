hitch.Do your research.
Whether your condition is osteoporosis, spinal stenosis or a slipped disc, there are many ( http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/backpain/backpain.htm#Organizations ) back pain associations and online resources available to you.
Before you decide to have back surgery, it is important to thoroughly understand both the risks and rewards of doing so.
As a starting point, you can search <a href=" http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS256&q=back+surgery&btnG=Search " target="new">Google</a>, <a href=" http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=back+surgery&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8 " target="new">Yahoo</a>,<a href=" http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=back+surgery&FORM=MSNH " target="new">MSN</a> or <a href=" http://www.ask.com/web?q=back+surgery&qsrc=0&o=0&l=dir " target="new">Ask.com</a> for back surgery information.
Participate in back pain forums/message boards and talk to other patients who have been through the same procedure that you are preparing to undergo.
You are likely to find new information, or at the very least you will find support from a community who has been down the same road.#
Prepare supportive ergonomic spaces.
Many patients have difficulty finding a comfortable position either sitting or laying down after back surgery.
Buy or borrow an ergonomic cushion set, make sure to have a very good ergonomic chair available, and if at all possible invest in an adjustable bed or mattress with adjustable firmness.
Don't smoke.
If you are a smoker, while it may make you a little anxious to be without your cigarettes, the health benefits overall - and specifically for your back - outweigh the dangers of continuing to smoke.
The carbon monoxide in cigarettes reduces oxygen in the blood supply and various components of the gases and particulate matter can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
These are risk factors prior to any surgery; however in some cases it is even more vital to avoid smoking prior to back surgery because smoking inhibits bone health and growth.
Eat a healthy and balanced diet, including more protein, and supplement with calcium and L-glutamine.
According to nutritionists at the University of Hawaii, L-glutamine is particularly effective in cases where significant amounts of body tissue must be repaired or replaced.
Calcium strengthens bones and protein allows wounds to heal faster.
