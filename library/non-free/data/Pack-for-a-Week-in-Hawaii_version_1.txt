Plan your wardrobe ahead of time.
During the days, the average temperature is between 81 and 88 and at nights, the average temperature can range between 68 and 75.
August is the hottest month, while January is the coolest.
Bags should be packed with loose clothing; jeans are a good suggestion for those cool nights.
Take "tourist accessories" with you : hat, sunglasses, camera, small backpack, walking shoes (for various hikes), and flip-flops (or "slippers").
Maps are another great suggestion since some of the best things about Hawaii are hidden, for example hiking trails and beaches.
Buy Hawaii clothing and souvenirs once you arrive in Hawaii.
ABC Stores, Wal-Mart, and Longs Drugs have some of the best clothing apparel and items to take back with you.
But, be aware that if you do buy polyester, flower-print clothing, you will stick out like a sore thumb.
Don't forget your swimsuit !
