ragsClean the room.
Start by dusting the room.
Vacuum or mop the floor.
Also, be sure to clean any mirrors as your guests will surely want to see if they look as good as your room makes them feel!
Prepare the bed.
Take off the old sheets and make up the bed with fresh, clean ones.
Pile up the pillows and turn down the sheets to create an inviting place to curl up.
Make some space for your guests.
This may mean putting away some items, clearing out a drawer and/or cleaning out the closet.
Be sure to leave some empty hangers for guests too.
Add a warm and welcoming touch to the room.
By adding the next few items you can make your guests feel more comfortable during their stay:
clean towels
an alarm clock - make sure the alarm is off though!
a box of tissues
a reading lamp and some magazines or one of your favorite books
a bedside carafe with fresh water, or at least a clean glass
an extra blanket if it's cool out, or a fan if it's warm
Provide some simple luxuries for your guests like a robe, chocolates and a vase with fresh flowers.
Clean the bathroom.
Clean the bathroom as usual, and make sure there is soap, a clean hand towel and ample toilet paper.
It is also a good idea to make sure there is a plunger visible to prevent guests from having to ask.
If guests are staying more than a night, empty a drawer or clear a space on the counter for their toiletries.
Leave a note.
Don't make your guests have to ask or guess where to find basic items like a hairdryer or iron.
If you can't leave things out in plain view, leave a simple note in the bedroom explaining where each item is kept and any instructions they may need to know.
*This is especially helpful if there is a TV in the guest bedroom with either a tricky remote or different channels than the guest is familiar with.
