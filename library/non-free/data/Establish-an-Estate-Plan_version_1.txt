out.Create a trust.
The foundation of a good estate plan is a trust.
A trust is an agreement between the person creating the trust, and the person managing the trust.
Modern trust law allows the creator (aka "Grantor," "Trustor," or "Settlor") to also be the Trustee and primary beneficiary.
In other words you create a legal "fiction" that you no longer own your own property.
Decide on who will have the power of attorney.
Powers of Attorney for property and health are also part of a good estate plan.
A property power of attorney is necessary to deal with financial issues when a person is mentally disabled, for what ever reason, including banking, retirement and Social Security accounts.
Health Care Powers of Attorney are used when a person is unable to communicate health care decisions to health care providers.
Write a will.
Wills are also necessary, even when you have a trust.
These wills are called "Pour-Over Wills" and direct that assets not in trust be placed in trust.
