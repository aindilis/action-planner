books.Write a plan . You need to plan out the beginning and brain-storm or if you choose not to, you need to know what your story is about.
Decide how long you want your beginning to be.
Start writing.
Don't rush into the story too fast.
If, while you're writing, you realize that you rushed into the story by the second or third chapter, you need to backtrack.
Add your chapters.
Add chapters in the beginning, like what the main character was doing before so-and-so came along.
If you choose to do this, you need to make sure that you still keep readers interested.
For example, maybe the character sees a certain person everywhere and the character has no clue who they are, but it seems that that one person is following them.
