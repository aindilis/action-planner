Purchase or make your decorations for the party.
If you're holding a big party, you might want to put more effort into decorating for you party than for your yard; it all depends on how many hands are on deck to help out!
Make the decorations well in advance so that you're not rushed.
Consider what food you will serve.
There are many different ideas for Halloween food that you can find in magazines, books, and online.
wikiHow has its own section too - check out Halloween Food & Treats.
Make the food in advance where possible, especially if it's tricky (such as making hands, skulls, etc.)
Prepare a music mix.
Do this well in advance and set up the music where it can be heard easily.
Plan Halloween games if you want to have them.
These will need to take into account guest numbers, ages, and interests.
Look online for Halloween party game ideas.
Put out the decorations on the day of the party.
Move furniture out of the way, make sure that there is plenty of free space for guests to mill around, dance, play games, etc. Put the food in an easily accessible place but not somewhere that impedes movement.
