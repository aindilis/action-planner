addressBuy a poker chip set.
The most realistic affordable size is 500 chip 11.5 gram weight set.
A 1000 chip set will easily allow you to host a 2 table 20 player tournament.
You will need a minimum of 8 players and a maximum of 20 depending on your poker chip set.
Start the blind at 10-20 and every 15 minutes raise them.
This way the tournament doesn't run all night.
If your chip set has more than 3 colours, assign the extras to large chip amounts like 500 and 1000.
This way you can colour up and remove the smaller chips.
Make sure to keep the buy-in (entry fee) reasonable.
You don't want to discourage people from joining.
A $5 entry is reasonable to most who play poker.
