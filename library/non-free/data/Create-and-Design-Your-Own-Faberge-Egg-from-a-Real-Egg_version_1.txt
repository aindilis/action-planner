useTake the egg and place the straight pin on the smaller side of the egg.
Take the hammer and lightly tap the end of the pin until is makes a small hole in the end of the egg.
Take the pin and put it in the egg to break the yolk.
This will make it easier for draining the egg.
Turn the egg so that the pinhole end is on bottom and let the yolk drain out.
It may take a while for the egg to drain and you may have to help it along by moving the pin around the hole slightly.
After the egg has drained, rinse the egg out by running water into the existing hole and then turn it back over to drain.
After it is clean, let it dry thoroughly.
When the egg is dry you can draw your favorite design, something you collect in sports memorabilia, or maybe your high school mascot.
It is best to draw on the egg with a pencil, and remember to draw lightly.
Paint the design you drew.
The type of paint you use is important because you want something that will last and that will stick to the egg.
Spray the egg with clear enamel spray and let dry thoroughly.
This will make the egg shine.
