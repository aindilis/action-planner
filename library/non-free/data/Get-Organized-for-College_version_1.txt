happened.Make a free account with Google.
Go to www.google.com/calendar to do this.
This gives you your own free, personal calendar that you can use to track all of your events, assignments, work, etc.
Get your course syllabi and put them in a stack. 
Go under the settings panel in Google Calendar and choose Add calendar.
Call it assignments or school or whatever you want.
This will be used to keep track of your assignments.
It would be best if you change the color to red so it stands out more because this is the most important aspect of college.
Input projects, tests, papers, lab times, office hours and even class times in your new assignments calendar.
Under the details/description field enter as much data as you can in case you lose your syllabus.
Make a second calendar called Personal or something like that.
In here you can put all of your plans with friends, Greek Life, trips to the gym, campus events etc.
If you have a smart-phone, get a calendar app.
I recommend, for Android, Jorte or Business Calendar.
Sync your calendar to your phone so it's always with you.
