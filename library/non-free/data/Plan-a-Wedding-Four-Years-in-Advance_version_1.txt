okay.So, the first step is to NOT do this.
Everything can change in a couple of years!
How do you know you wont find out that your so called "hubby" is a cheating jerk who would trade you FOR A DUMB BRUNETTE WITH A NOSE PIERCING?
Sorry, that was not supposed to come out.
Don't let this be you
Find the one that wont leave you.
Because, if I was him, I would back out now.
But, really, make sure you don't break up with him 2 years into planning your wedding.
Don't let your hubby see your planning.
He will back out VERY quickly and GO FOR THAT STUPID BRUNETTE!
Sorry, that wasn't supposed to happen.
