school)Consider the benefits of attending a Catholic high school.
Why are you choosing a Catholic school?
If you are a Roman Catholic, it is sensible to choose a Catholic school, as you will learn about your faith in school.
If you're not Catholic, you might still want to attend a Catholic school for its academics or athletic program.
It's important to know what you'd like to get out of Catholic school so that you can narrow down your choices.
Do a little research.
Visit the school website or attend an event at the school, such as a dance or a play.
Learn what the school excels in to make sure that attending the school will benefit you.
If you love art, for example, it'd be best to choose a school with a good art program.
Try to eliminate some choices if you don't like them.
Take the high school scholarship/placement exam to try to get in at your-4 top choices.
If there's one or two really top choices, take a practice exam before taking those schools' tests.
Shadow.
Shadowing is a common practice in Catholic schools that helps potential incoming students to decide whether they'd like to attend a school.
On a shadow day, you follow a student around through his/her classes and get to see what an average school day is like.
Stay open to all schools.
Don't eliminate a school because it has nasty toilets or an ugly-coloured uniform; the main priorities you should keep in mind when picking a Catholic school are education, whether the school caters to your interests, and how the school will help you to grow in your faith (religion is at the core of all Catholic schools).
