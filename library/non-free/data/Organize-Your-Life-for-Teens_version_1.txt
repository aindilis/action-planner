pet.Make a list of things you do regularly, like after school activities, sports, or hobbies.
Include the scheduled days and times for each activity.
Next make a list of chores that you do and the schedule of when they should be done.
[If you make a really drastic change in how much you help around the house and with your room your parents may pay you.]
If you have a messy room you can't get an organized life.
Start in one corner of the room.
If you haven't used something in a year and it's not sentimental try to give it away to a charity.
If you need motivation set a timer for 15 minutes.
After that take a little break.
Try to clean anything that needs cleaning like your locker, desk, or backpack
Now that you have a list of all the things your doing, and your room is clean, it's time to get a calender or planner.
Write down all your upcoming assignments, projects, field trips, sports, etc.
Now your room is clean, you have a list of chores, and your activities.
Now you have to add in things like when your going to exercise, do homework, hang out, etc.
That's all there is to it.
Stick to your schedule, keep your room clean, do your homework, and you will have organized your life.
