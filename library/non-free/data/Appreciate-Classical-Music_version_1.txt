rests!Understand that not all classical music is the same.
Some pieces are very fast and harsh, while others are very graceful, slow and light.
Some music is done with a voice, some with string instruments, and some with woodwind and brass.
Knowing what kind you like to listen to will make it a whole lot easier to listen as well.
Find out more about it, such as who it was composed by, whether it's been in any shows, and which instrument has the melody.
Be willing to listen.
You need to give it a chance to learn to like it.
Listen to the notes, patterns, and small details.
Notice what each insturment brings to the piece.
Try going to a live orchestral concert, choral concert, chamber concert, or band concert.
Try to pick out the sounds of individual sections like the strings, woodwinds, brass or percussion.
Discerning these components of the music can increase your appreciation of the piece.
Then pick out individual instrument and see if you can hear the part they play.
Many churches, such as the Catholic church, have classical music influences in their liturgical music.
