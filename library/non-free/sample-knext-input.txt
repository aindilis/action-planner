Get some file folders and a pen.
You will need 1 large box and a file box to put the files in.
If you have many piles, start with the smallest.
Eat the elephant one bite at a time.
Mark boxes, TRASH, and FILE and begin sorting just on these two categories.
If you keep an article of paper make a file for that subject, (example : Unpaid Bills).
Put the bill in the file folder and label the tab Unpaid Bills and set it in the file box.
Keep making files for whatever subject you need to file labeling them as you go.
These could be anything you think is important to keep: birthday cards, car information, checking account, dental, home loan information, home maintenance, insurance, medical, unpaid bills, utilities, etc.
The best place to file something is where it is most obvious  to you.
Put things where you think they should go and it will be easiest for you to find them later.
In another box marked "Trash" put in  junk mail , duplicate bills, old papers that you know you will never really need.
Touch it once.
Either file it or throw it out.
Make sub files if you want to.
After you file your papers you might want to make files within files that are close to the same subject.
For example, you could divide car information into car insurance, recalls/warranties, repairs,and copies of titles and registrations.
This way you have all the info when you need it.
Start at the mailbox for new papers that come in.
When you get your mail out of your mailbox, go through right away and toss the junk.
When you get into the house, make it a point to place it near your file cabinet.
Choose a specific time that fits your schedule to open your mail and sort it on a daily basis.
You could put unpaid bills in a folder in the front of the file box to help you to remember to pay them.
File the important things and toss the rest in the trash can located next to your file cabinet.
