Here are some considerations for evaluating lives objectively.

First, you have the concept of reducible.  Suppose one life, call it
L_1 is reducible to another life, call it L_2.  Take the simple case
where L_1 := {alive(person)}, and L_2 := {not(alive(person))}.  Then
we have Reducible(L_1,L_2) and not(Reducible(L_2,L_1)).  We should
probably define a transition function which tells use which states can
proceed from others.  The inherent assumption here is that one can die
but not be resurrected.

This reducible concept might be related to transposition tables in
Chess and other games.  One thing that I want to make clear is that
there could be equivalence classes of positions wrt certain
properties.  So for instance, given all of the possible moves, it may
not be possible to reduce one life to another, but it may be possible
to reduce one life to one that is similar to another.

We could also think in terms of measuring the effort involved in
transitioning from one life to another.

We also want to think in terms of sequences and histories, and
measures on how good these are.

We should also take into account subjective judgments and valuations
of situations.

Also want to consider mobility, changes in subjective valuations.

Need to determine a precise definition of a life.
