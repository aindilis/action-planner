About $10 worth will be just enough for the average suburban lawn.
As soon as the ground is thawed in the spring, rake it relatively flat.
It doesn't have to be perfect; the clover will cover up minor bumps and valleys.

In a wheelbarrow, mix the seed with garden soil or tri-mix.
(Clover will grow in almost any kind of dirt, so any reasonably clean fill will do.)
Try to have about four seeds per square inch of soil.
Three will fail to germinate, so you'll be left with the ideal one plant per inch.
With a shovel, evenly spread the mix over the ground.
Make sure there are seeds everywhere.
Go back to where you started and cover the mix with 1/4 inch of plain (unseeded) soil.
Spread thinly, as clover shoots can't break through more than 1/2 inch of earth.
