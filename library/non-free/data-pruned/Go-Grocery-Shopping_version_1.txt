break.Search your closets, cabinets, and bed-side table to see what items you need : milk, yogurt, bread or cereal, meat.
Ideally, you (and everyone and your household) should make a habit of writing down whenever something is running out (or already has).
For example, if someone starts using the last (or second to last) toilet paper roll, make it that person's responsibility to put "toilet paper" on the list.
A good place to keep such a list is on the refrigerator.
Make a Shopping List that is necessary during the week.
This consists of the items you need to replenish, as well as new stuff you want to get.
Plan out your meals for the next week or two and write down the ingredients you'll need.
When you make the list, try to group items together based on where they are in the supermarket or grocery store.
Put all the produce together, all the meat together, all the dairy together, etc.
Go by the aisles one at a time to see what you need.
Check the sale prices and compare between brands before buying the products.
Bulk quantities are often, but not always, cheaper.
