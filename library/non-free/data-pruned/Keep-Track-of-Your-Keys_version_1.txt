charged!)Consistency is the key to keeping your keys.
Decide which pocket you will carry your keys in and stick to it religiously.
You should always know to check your left front pocket for the keys, for instance.
You need a safe place at home to keep your keys, and you must never put them down anywhere else.
This means that you have to empty your pockets as soon as you get home.
When you use your keys, make a habit of carefully replacing them in their proper pocket, just as you make a habit of locking and unlocking doors.
This will require a conscious effort until your routine is firmly established.
