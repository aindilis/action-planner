environmentBegin your letter with an engaging beginning.
For example, you might begin with what the weather is like or what prompted you to write the letter in the first place.
You might begin- "Dear John, After a long day at work, I just wanted to jot you a note to tell you I was thinking of you."
Add some "meaty" information about what you're doing these days.
Tell the person what is happening in your life or tell them the main reason for your letter.
For example, you might say : "John, for some time I have been thinking about how much fun we had at our last gathering.
Wasn't it funny when we......"
Include a "highlight" or a "problem".
For example, you may add: "The greatest thing about our time together was..." or "The worst possible situation occurred when it rained and we couldn't..."
Go into detail about general things in your life.
You might talk about the dogs, cats, kids, or family members in your life.
You could write about your work situation.
Just a few sentences will do!
Close your letter with a recap of your first thoughts.
Look again at your first and second paragraphs and retell something from that to close your writing.
For example you might end your letter by saying..."Well, it's been a long day but I did end it well in writing to you.
The road is always short to a friend's mailbox!
