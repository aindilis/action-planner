This is especially important for those who are going at it the first time.
See more details about this on How to Start a Farm.
When you do start a dairy farm for the first time, make sure you plan out things like manure management, herd health practices, feed rations, breeding schedules for each cow, calving , human resources (as you may need to hire some people to help you), weaning , calf care, milking cows , harvesting crops, etc. All of these should be completed before you start on the next steps.
Capital.
If you are looking to buy a dairy farm that already has the capital (buildings, equipment, machinery) needed, then you only have to check to make sure it has adequate sterile facilities for storing and pasteurizing milk, barns for holding cows, corrals, areas of feed and manure storage, a milking parlor, and enough land to grow feed for your cows.
If you are buying a piece of land that you need to build buildings on, then make sure you build silos, barns, manure holding lagoons or sloughs, corrals, stanchions for cows for milking (typically in the milk parlor) and area where it is easy to AI cows.
You will also need a calving facility, and a facility where you can keep the calves you have to pull off the cows so they can be bottle fed and the cows go into milk production.
Make sure the size of the buildings match the size of herd you are wishing to not start with , but have when you have reached your maximum dairy herd size.
Find a company you can sell your milk to.
You may also have to go through some paperwork sent out by the government too, among other things.
In Canada, a quota of 100 cows has to be met in order to be qualified as a dairy farm.
(Quota means minimum allowable amount of animals to start and to have in dairy production.)
