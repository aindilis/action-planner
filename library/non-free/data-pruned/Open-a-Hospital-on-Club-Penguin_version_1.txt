aloneMake sure you have a double-level igloo.
You need lots of room.
In the bottom level, put lots of chairs or couches.
This will be the waiting room.
Have little tables with snacks or flowers in front of chairs.
Buy a ticket booth or a half-circle table.
Put a chair behind it.
This will be the spot where people will request a spot in the hospital.
If possible, put a TV in the waiting room.
Put the channel on the two penguins racing.
For the upstairs, buy many (6-15) lounge chairs, or 3 or 4 couches put together with snow lumps on top.
Place them throughout the upstairs, none too close.
These will be hospital beds.
Make sure to leave an area in the corner by the door.
Put puffle water bottles-not bowls-on the edge of each hospital bed.
Beside the beds, put normal chairs.
These will be for doctors to sit.
If you can afford it, put a computer desk behind each lounge chair.
Have at least 3 sinks somewhere in the hospital.
These will be for doctors to wash hands.
Place two cabinets in the hospital (downstairs or upstairs work).
These will be medicine cabinets.
In the corner by the door, put puffle bed near the outer edge.
You should have a small area.
Put inside the area a wooden chair.
On the chair, put a water bowl.
You now have a toilet.
Clean the toilet seats often as some penguins may "throw up" in the toilet and partially "miss".
If there is room, put a recycle bin.
Putting in many is a good idea because some penguins will pretend to throw up and they'll have something to "throw up" in and you don't have to clean up the vomit afterward.
Add 1-2 TVs around the hospital.
Go to the town, plaza, pizza parlor, and other popular areas to advertise.
Say "Hospital at my place !" or "Hospital at my iggy!
We need docs!" or "DOCS NEEDED AT MY PLACE" or "HOSPITAL AT MY IGGY PATIENTS NEEDED" or something like that.
After about five minutes of this, go to your igloo.
Watch the sick penguins populate your hospital.
