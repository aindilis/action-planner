anything.Buy a cute planner for the current year.
Let the child choose it with you so that they'll like it but make sure it's small and thin enough.
You don't want your tiny little boy/girl lugging a dictionary sized planner all day long!
Sit down with them and try, with their help, to recall the closest commitments and put them in the planner.
Maybe aunt Susan's birthday dinner next Friday, maybe the big brother's softball game next Saturday morning: Write it down!
Explain how the planner works and how should you fill it out, according to the planner's layout.
Explain they can't have two things at the same time but can postpone things to an empty slot in the planner.
