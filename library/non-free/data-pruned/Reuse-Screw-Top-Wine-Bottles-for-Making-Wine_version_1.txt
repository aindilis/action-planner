(optional)Baking the bottle with preserve the labels for use later
You can use the labels for art or scrap booking
Soaking bottles - a great excuse to do dishes!
You'll need to remove the labels from the bottles first.
To keep them intact for scrap booking or art , place them in the oven for 10 minutes at 100 degrees.
This melts the glue, so after peeling up the corner with a knife, you can peel the rest off with a finger.
If you don't care about the label, soak the bottle in a sink full of warm water and a tiny bit of soap.
Make sure it fill the bottles so they aren't buoyant.
After 30 minutes, peel them off.
Clean out the bottles.
If you used the soak method to remove the labels, then a lot of this is done for you.
Be very careful!
You get better with practice...
The next step is to remove the collar from the bottle.
Wedge a screw driver in the space between the collar and the bottle.
BE CAREFUL - this is dangerous as a slip of the hand can cause the screw driver to slip.
Two methods are to start using the screw driver and then pull the rest off with pliers, or simply keep applying downward pressure while twisting the screw driver.
