always.Let the chicken wings defrost.
Try not to use warm water to defrost frozen chicken as it tends to start the cooking process raising the meat to a dangerous temperature level in which bacteria can grow.
While waiting on the chicken to defrost, pour oil in skillet or fry daddy and turn heat on high.
Drain excess water, and put them in a large bowl.
Season the chicken wings with desired seasonings.
Take the seasoned chicken and place it in the hot grease to begin the frying.
When the chicken has become golden brown, take it out and put it on a napkin to drain the grease.
Pour a cup of hot sauce and a half stick of butter, in the medium skillet, until it comes to a boil.
Note:You may increase the amount of hot sauce and butter depending on the amount of chicken you are preparing
Place the chicken into the combined mixture and reduce the heat so that the temperature goes down.
The wings are done when they are sauced completely and the sauce has thickened.
Buy a bag of frozen, pre-cut wings.
The tips are already gone.
After they are thawed, drain the wings and spread them out on a cookie sheet that you have sprayed with Pam.
Bake the wings at 350 for about half an hour.
Take the baked wings outside and put them on a hot grill to crisp them up and give them that grilled taste.
This method will result in boneless chunks (not so much wings)
Take a boneless chicken breast, and cut it into slices, make them fairly thick.
Turn the breast around and cut perpendicular to the other cuts (making approximate 1" cubes)
Dip the cubes into a bowl of eggs (mixed) then roll in a mixture of flour, cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and anything else dry you wish to add.
Drop the chunks into a 350 degree deep fryer for 4 minutes (or more, depending on how crispy you would like the breading to be.)
