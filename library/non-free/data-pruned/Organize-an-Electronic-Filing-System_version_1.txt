awayDecide what information you want to organize electronically.
Create one main electronic folder that will hold all others related to the set of information you wish to organize.
You may choose to label this folder whatever you like, however, most computers will have a basic default setup of folders including My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, etc. that may be useful for this purpose.
Hint - when labeling folders, try to be as concise as possible, using the least amount of words that will clearly convey what the folder contains.
Depending on the amount of information that you wish to organize, you may also need to create subfolders within the main folder.
For example, if you were trying to organize your taxes electronically, you might label the main folder "Taxes" and each subfolder by year.
This type of folder-subfolder organization will keep your files in quick and easy access.
Within the folders, it is best to include dates on all documents, and arrange them chronologically by such.
You may want to include the date of the document in its file name as well.
Be sure to continue backing up your files to a disk, preferably every three to four weeks.
