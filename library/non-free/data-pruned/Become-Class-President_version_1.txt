someday!Make sure you really want the job.
It can be a lot of work and responsibility, and your efforts might not always be appreciated.
Choose a close friend as campaign manager.
Make sure he or she is confident.
Also, make sure he or she doesn't do anything stupid such as rip down opponent's posters.

Put up posters and hand out flyers and stickers.
Go from class to class giving a short speech.
Make it humorous, but also touch on the major issues.
Give little signs to supporters to put on their lockers -"Vote for ------- "(slogan here)".

Even better, make a group on Facebook and invite all your friends.
Put up either a funny, or if not funny, very good picture of you for the group's profile picture.
Make T-shirts for you and your campaign crew.
Be nice to everyone, no exception, because many people will vote for you because they like you.
Smile in the hallways.
Make eye contact.
They'll care if you're responsible, but if they like you, so much better.
Be responsible, study and get good grades, show everyone that you're responsible enough to be class president.
It helps if you have a reputation for being smart, which you are.
