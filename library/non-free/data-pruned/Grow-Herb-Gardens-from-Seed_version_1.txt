vitamin.Soak the seeds in water for a few hours, or even overnight, before planting them.
Seeds inside pots
Assemble the soil and containers for growing the seeds in.
Poke holes in the bottom of your containers for drainage.
Fill containers full with a soil mixture.
Pat down the soil to be sure there are no air pockets or your seeds might drop right to the bottom.
Sow the herb seeds 1-3 times deeper than the size of the seed.
Very tiny seeds need only to be pressed into the soil.
Water the seeds and cover the containers with plastic kitchen wrap.
This will keep the soil warm and eliminate the need to water until the seedlings emerge.
Place flats in a warm, sunny area.
Until the seeds emerge, keep the soil damp.
Seedlings emerging
Remove the plastic once the seedlings emerge.
If you plan to transfer your seedlings to the garden, wait until at least two sets of leaves have emerged.
Once it is warm enough, start leaving them outside a few hours a day.
This will "harden them off" and get them ready for the harsher outdoor conditions.
Water well.
