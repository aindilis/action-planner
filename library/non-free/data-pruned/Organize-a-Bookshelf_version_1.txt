products?Take everything out of the bookshelf.
It's so much easier to start with a blank slate!
Remove books that you no longer want.
Look them up on Bookscouter.com to see if any websites are buying them.
Otherwise you box them up and donate them to local charities or libraries.
If you have books you can give to charity, set those aside now.
Books to choose for this can be books that you never read, books your children have outgrown, or books you are not interested in keeping.
Doing this helps your bookshelves remain clutter-free.
Decide how you want to categorize the books.
Popular choices are by author, title, and subject.
But if you want to organize them by height and color, this is also fine, although it might take a little extra work.
Another good way to organize books is fiction/non-fiction.
Also, you can put all the books you haven't yet read together, and books that you have read together.
That way, when you're looking for a good book to read, all of the un-read books are together.
Spread out all the books on a floor, bed, etc. Begin organizing them into categories.
After they are all organized, double-check to make sure you don't have a book by Zoe Zucker next to a book by Andrew Ardell, if you're going alphabetically.
Transfer each category into the bookshelf.
When organizing a child's shelf,kid's books tend to be taller than adult ones.
Try stacking these on the tallest shelf.
If you don't have a tall shelf to put your taller books in, then after your finish organizing the other books, put it on top of the other books already put into the shelf, horizontally with the spine facing out
Place binding side outwards.
When placing the books on the shelf, make sure all of the book spines are facing you.
