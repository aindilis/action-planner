1 Take your new cat to the vet, unless he is from a shelter and the vets there have already examined him.
Be gentle and patient when handling the cat.
Speak to him in a calm, reassuring voice.
Give him a quiet place to rest undisturbed in your home until he gets used to his new surroundings.
Make sure there is not a big crowd around him.
Remember that abandoned cats usually have a bad history; so don't force him to do something he doesn't like.
