roads.Think of where you are going.
Is it somewhere warm and humid, or cold and dry?
Do they have somewhere to swim like a beach or pool?
Keep where you're going in mind.
Now take out paper or Word and make a list.
You might want to write down these things, and then add more as you think of it:
-For somewhere warm- Short sleeve shirts, shorts or bermudas, hat, flip-flops, tennis shoes, sweatshirt (just in case)
-For somewhere cold- Coat(s), sweaters, long pants, long sleeve shirts, blanket, hat(s), gloves, scarf, leggings, long johns
-For somewhere with a place to swim (you can add these to the lists above): Swimsuit, goggles, flippers, swim shoes, swim cap, towels, sunscreen
Other things to bring are a camera, snacks/food, and things to do on the trip (portable DVD player, puzzles, iPod, gameboy, DS, books, laptop, etc.)
Pick out a bag that's a suitable size to fit everything you're bringing.
Make sure you can organize all of your things neatly in this without having them wrinkled or ruined.
A good idea is to keep liquids, or items that may leak, in a plastic bag.
Get out all of the things you're going to bring.
Sort them out on your bed or table.
Open your suitcase and put it to the side, including opening little side pouches.
Organize your things neatly in your bag.
Make sure everything fits and that they won't get messed up while in the bag.
You can fit small cosmetic items or brushes in the side pouches, which may help you out so you aren't searching around for it in the bag.
