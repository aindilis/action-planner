1 Get the boxes.
If you can't find them locally, look online.
You can use any measurements you want, as long as four long boxes (drawers) fit into one cubic box (compartment).
Here are some suggested measurements and quantities:
25 to 500 cubic boxes - 13 x 13 x 13 inches (33 x 33 x 33 cm)
to 900 long boxes - 12 x 6 x 6 inches (30.5 x 15.25 x 15.25 cm)
Assemble the cubic boxes into a shelving unit.
Cut the flaps on one side.
Tape the cubes together - front, back and side.
When taping is completed, put the completed shelving unit against a wall.
Assemble the long boxes, which will be drawers.
Cut out a square at one end of the box.
Four drawers fit in one compartment.
Write the description on the box.
Then, put the drawers in so that the order makes sense.
Sort the drawers alphabetically.
Alternatively, sort the drawers so that things you use most often are at arm level, easiest to reach, and things that are less frequently used are lower or higher.
Slide the drawers into the compartments.
Use compartments without the drawers for larger objects.
Use small containers to store small objects.
These are tennis ball cans.
Check with your local tennis club - you might get hundreds of them for free.
