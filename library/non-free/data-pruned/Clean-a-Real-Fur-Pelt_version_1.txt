ahead.Obtain some cornstarch.
Spread the cornstarch all over the fur.
Rub it in to the fur with a damp cloth.
The corn starch will absorb the dirt and the fur will be clean just like new.
Make sure that the cloth is only damp, not dripping wet; wring well before use.
Finish the clean-up by vacuuming out the cornstarch.
Brush the fur coat back to its usual pile.
Repeat if very dirty.
