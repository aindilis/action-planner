(optional)Take acting lessons.
While acting lessons can be expensive, there are plenty of one day workshops that may be available in your area.
Stage acting and film acting are different, but if you have no acting experience any beginning acting class or workshop will do.
Make a resume . Write down a list of all of the acting classes, and acting jobs that you have done, then put them into resume format.
If you need an example of how to write an acting resume, check out http://theater.about.com/library/blsampres.htm for an example.
If you have no acting experience, still make a resume stating your objective.
Get a headshot.
A standard headshot is 8 x 10" but in the paid extras business, sometimes the casting director will accept a 3 x 5" photo.
A headshot is a picture that primarily shows a closeup of your head and neck.
Your headshot should be recent, and show you in your most attractive natural state.
Professional headshots can be pricey, but if you know a photographer, or have a digital camera and printer, you should be ok for extra work.
Look for paid extra roles.
Here's where you have to do some work.
Some free ways to do this are to look up your states film commission on the internet.
Usually if you do a search in a search engine you will find your state's.
From there you can see all of the movies, etc. that are coming to your area.
Submit your headshot and resume along with a cover letter.
A cover letter expresses your desire to be a part of the movie production.
It should be short explaining who you are and instructing the casting director to take a look at your headshot and resume.
Some movie extra sites instruct you to email your materials, so keep files of your headshot, resume, and coverletter on your computer.
Some ask you to just show up, while others ask for you to mail in your headshot and resume
