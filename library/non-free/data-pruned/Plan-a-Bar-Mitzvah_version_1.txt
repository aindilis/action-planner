imagination!Make sure your synagogue knows it's his Bar Mitzvah soon.
You should start planning when he is ten/eleven.
Inform them of the date.
Find his Parsha.
Usually, the synagogue chooses, but you might get to choose.
Have him to practice his parsha every day for a good hour.
Don't use a no vowel sheet unless you are sure he can read it, because it is very difficult to read.
Plan the reception if you will have one.
If you will not have one, skip this step.
Plan where it will be held.
I suggest a banquet hall of some sort, and once found, inform the place.
Then you can go straight to theme ideas, or even investing in an event planner for extra help.
Lots of people use "themes" like favorite color or sport, but a theme is completely unnecessary since this event has a built-in one: Bar Mitzvah.
Save the themes for birthday parties where they belong.
Send out invitations to friends and family, no matter how far.
Many will come to see a Bar-Mitzvah.
Tell the name, date, time for both service and party, and the parsha.
Also try and match the invitation to the theme of your party.
Wait until you receive a reply from someone.
If it is a yes, write their name down somewhere.
If it is a no, write a "sorry" note to them.
Work on food, entertainment and party favours or prizes.
this is crutial to any Bar or Bat mitzvah as well as a common curtosy and entertainment for your guests.
See if your event planner has any good ideas with this are of planning.
Prepare a speech to say to your son.
It is the custom for the parents and rabbi to say a speech for him, and a tradition for the son to say a speech to the congregation.
Remember to practice!
Find the correct attire For shul, make sure to buy your son a tallite and a propper suit and kippot.
For the mother, a knee length skirt with a suit jacket and hat will be appropriate, and for the father, a suit, tallite and kippot.
