When you wash on Monday, it's a good idea to change your sheets also.
If you separate your clothes into 3 loads - very dark, lighter colored, white - you only have to fill up the washer three times.
Set your ironing on Tuesday.
Place your ironing board in a place where you can conveniently watch television, to make the time go by.
Relax on Wednesday.
On Thursday, do some dusting and vacuuming upstairs.
