facilitator.More often than not, your teacher will give you a textbook to take home.
This is a gift.
Don't let it go to waste.
Use it to review what you went over in class today.
Take notes on each chapter as the class progresses through it.
This includes writing out definitions for all new words you encounter.
Every night, study this material for about five to ten minutes.
If you're lucky and your textbook comes with a workbook, CD-ROM, or study guide.
Use those to aid yourself in studying.
You can type your notes if you want, since it will run them through your brain a second time, but this is not required to be prepared.
Do your homework as soon as you get home.
A large portion of quizzes come from your homework.
The material will sink into your brain easier, and you'll memorize things faster.
Review your material before classes.
Not just before the class pertaining to the material.
Since you're in learning mode at school, you'll remember more of the information.
Get someone else to review the information with you.
Just find a parent, sibling, or friend to test you on your notes to see if you know them.
There's a difference between memorizing your notes and knowing them, and there's no better way to know things than being tested.
Don't be anxious about a pop quiz.
Accept that it will happen, but don't get scared.
When the test day finally comes, keep a positive mindset.
Repeat to yourself that you are going to get an A on the quiz.
The more positive you are, the better you do.
Check your answers.
Usually, teachers take of points for trivial matters, such as spelling.
Make sure your answers are paired with the right question number.
As stupid as this sounds, it does happen.
