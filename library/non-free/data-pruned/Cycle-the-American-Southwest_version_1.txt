out.Pick a start and end point.
Figure out where you want to go to before you head off.
There are several factors that should influence your choice:
The elevation plays a factor.
Generally speaking, from El Paso TX heading westwards till Colorado River, there is a drop in elevation making it easier to cycle.
The desert is a real factor.
It's hot, dusty, lonely, and lacks services and water.
Be aware that most National Parks and National Forests have specific restrictions on where you can ride.
[] Check their websites when planning your route.
You also need to ensure that there is some way to transport your bike to and back on your journey, unless you are supported, then you just need to be driven back.
If you do not have that luxury, look where the Amtrak pick-up points are [] , or check out where you can fly in and out.
If you fly, note that you need to box up your bike.
Snow and cactus!
Pick a good time to go.
A large portion of the Southwest is a desert.
So if you go during summer, expect to deal with an average of 100 F (or 38 C).
Winter temperatures can drop below freezing and you can even see snow in the desert!
The windows between these two seasons may be the most pleasant.

Choose your route.
This is not as easy as it sounds.
As there are only a few proper roads going across this region, you may actually need to use the interstates for certain stretches.

Stretches of the Interstate that you can take include the I-10 and the I-8.
Note that if you're cycling from California to Arizona and New Mexico , using Interstates is unavoidable.

Some things you should consider taking with you include:
Puncture proof tubes (for the cacti and rough roads)
Clothing, including hats, sunglasses , bandanna, etc.
Sunscreen and bug repellent
First Aid kit
Maps, maybe GPS/compass, elevation and temperature indicator (usually a watch combination is best), etc.
Puncture kit, extra inner tubes, and other relevant spare parts
Sufficient food and water; use a suitable water holder that you can access easily while riding.
Book accommodation in advance.
This is especially important if you are frequenting highly touristed places or there aren't many lodgings available where you are going.
If you plan on camping, be sure to have the appropriate supplies and to update your outdoor knowledge, including treatment for snake bite and stings.
Always check local regulations on camping before camping wherever you feel like!
