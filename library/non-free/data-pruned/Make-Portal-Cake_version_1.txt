teaches.The night before you make the cake, mix 2/3 cup of cocoa powder with 18 ounces of vanilla frosting . Refrigerate overnight.
Save the rest of the vanilla frosting to be used later.
Before you make the cake, set the cocoa powder icing, cherries, and chocolate chips to the side.
These will not be used until the cake is completely finished.
Preheat the oven to 375 F/190.5 C. Lightly butter two 9-inch (22.8cm) cake pans.
Set out two mixing bowls.
In one, combine all remaining dry ingredients, and in the other (the larger one, if they aren't the same size), combine all remaining liquid ingredients.
Mix both bowls thoroughly.
Carefully sift the dry ingredients into the bowl of liquid ingredients and stir until it is evenly mixed.
Pour half of the batter into one cake pan, and the other half into the other.
Put both pans in the oven, and let them cook for at least half an hour, or until a knife or skewer inserted into the middle of both cakes can be removed cleanly.
When the cakes are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for at least an hour.
Remove one cake from its pan and set it on a plate, flat side up, and cover that flat side with coconut pecan frosting.
Then, place the other cake (flat side down) on top.
The icing should effectively "glue" the two halves together.
Frost the entire cake with the cocoa powder frosting.
It will be very stiff, so be warned that this can take some time and effort.
To make the process easier (and reduce the risk of accidentally destroying the cake), you can either melt the icing slightly or mix it with a little bit of water to make it easier to work with.
Coat the entire cake with chocolate chips by pressing them gently into the frosting to get them to stay.
Using the remaining vanilla frosting, dollop 8 evenly spaced circles around the top of the cake.
Place a maraschino cherry on top of each dollop.
