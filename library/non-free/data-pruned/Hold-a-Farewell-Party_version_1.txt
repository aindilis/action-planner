occasions.Choose where to hold the party . It could be at an office, at a venue such as a restaurant, or even at your own home, depending on who is being farewelled.
For a family member going overseas for a while, home is a good choice, while for a worker who is retiring or changing jobs, the office is suitable, or a local restaurant.
Send out invitations well in advance so that most people will be free to attend.
Make decorations.
One of the principal decorations that you might like to consider is a banner that says "Farewell XXX (their name)".
As well, you could also theme the decorations depending on the reason for the farewell:
Have little ships or planes for someone traveling overseas.
Have little clocks, timesheets, or similar work items for someone retiring.
Have decorations representing a new country or culture for someone moving to a new country.
Streamers are always good decorations and can be in the person's favorite colors, or symbolic of something to do with the farewell.
Organize the food.
Unless you're planning a sit-down meal, finger foods are just fine.
The only different food you might consider having is food from another country if the person is moving overseas.
Try to choose food that you know the person being farewelled likes a lot.
Organize people who might wish to give speeches . They could be speeches that talk about how great the person leaving is, how they have enjoyed working or spending time with them, etc. Ask those talking to keep it brief, to avoid dragging things out.
Ensure that there is an opportunity for the person being farewelled to respond if they wish but don't oblige them.
Organize a farewell gift . It is usual at farewell parties to present a gift or more to the person leaving.
For retirement, there are traditional gifts from a company but individuals should give things they know the person will like.
For someone traveling, find things that help a person travel.
