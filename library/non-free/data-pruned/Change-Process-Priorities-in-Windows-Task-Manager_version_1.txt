list.Hold down the keys "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" all at the same time.
A window will pop up, called "Windows Task Manager".
If not, a window with various options will pop up; click on "Task Manager".
Click on the "Processes" tab (2nd from left)
If you don't know which process you want, you can go to the "Applications" (left-most) tab, right-click on the window or program you want to speed up, and click on "Go to Process" - takes you right there !
Now right-click on the process you want to speed up.
Mouse over "Set Priority", OR just press the letter "p" on the keyboard, and click on the priority level you want for your program, OR, again, press the shortcut letter : L=Low, B=Below Normal, N=Normal, A=Above Normal, H=High, R=Realtime.
(These are underlined in the pop-up window.)
these priority names are intuitively obvious; they mean just what they say.
the priority level starts out at "Normal", and stays there unless YOU change it.
the higher (or lower) you set the program's 'priority', the more (or fewer) system resources will be allocated to it, so it will run faster (or slower) than it did before.
"Low", for example, is fine for a program running in background that you do not need to have finish up soon, so that more resources are freed up.
"Realtime" is best for something that absolutely has to have maximum resources right now!
Click "yes" when a confirmation window pops up.
