planners.Purchase a calendar with the appropriate space for you to list your tasks.
Some calendars offer weekly, daily, hourly breakouts.
A notebook can also be used.
Prioritize your tasks and allow necessary time to complete each task.
Remember to include travel time.
Try to complete your task in order of priority.
You can go through your list and write "A" next to important items that must be done first today, "B" next to items that must be done before tomorrow, "C" next to items that must be done this week, delegated or started.
Choose a priority system that fits you.
Stick to your schedule and move flexible items to another day should an emergency arise.
Check off tasks that are complete with a check mark.
You can make another notation next to items that must get postponed or can wait for tomorrow, have been canceled or that you've delegated (with the name of who is taking care of it).
Allow space at the bottom of your schedule for low priority items or things coming up later in the week.
If you have time today you can begin working on those items to get ahead.
Remember to transfer items not done today to tomorrow's list.
