addressStart with a clean slate.
Move everything off of the desk and place it on the floor or table next to you.
Throw out those things that are not needed, like old papers, or torn scraps of paper, or even an outdated picture.
Do not move things that are large and important-for example, a printer, or a desktop screen.
Prioritize ! Decide what are your most important and most-used items.
Items such as pencils, pens, scissors, important documents, and even hand lotion.
Place these in a drawer that is within an easy reach (or, in the case of pens and pencils, in a cup).
Your desk top should not have much on it.
If you have too much stuff on your desk, it will look cluttered.
You should keep on your desk a in/out tray, clock, lamp and a calendar.
You should not have your computer on your desk (unless it is a desktop computer).
If you have more than those items on your desk, it can look cluttered.
Put frequently used items in a easy to reach areas.
Like a shelf or a drawer.
Make sure you do not just throw the items on a shelf or a drawer.
It will be harder to find your items and be messy.
Items that are not used frequently do not need to be in an easy to reach area.
