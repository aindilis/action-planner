hatFind that perfect pencil case.
Make sure it's large enough so that it will hold everything you need.
Pencil cases with multiple pouches can hold a lot of stuff and keep it separate and organized.
If you carry your pencil case in your binder, choose a pencil case that fits in a binder.
You might also like to have an in-binder three hole punch while you're improving your binder.
Get materials to fill the case.
Check out your school's supply list for specific needs, or think back through your usual homework assignments.
Some basics would be pencils, pens, erasers, highlighters, colored pencils,sticky notes, a glue stick, scissors, and lead or a pencil sharpener (depending on whether you use mechanical pencils).
Remember to check materials you already have around from last year before spending lots of money.
Can you refill your pens, pencils, or erasers and keep on using them?
Carry only the essentials in your pencil case.
Only use some items sometimes?
Leave them in your locker (or desk, if you're in elementary school), place them in your backpack, or leave them at home to use for homework.
