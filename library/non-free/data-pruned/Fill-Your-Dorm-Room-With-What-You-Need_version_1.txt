paperFreezerPanSpoonWrite a list of the stuff you know you need.
A good start can be found below.
Bedding (sheets, comforter, pillows, mattress pad.
A lot of colleges use Twin Extra Long mattresses which are a few inches longer than a regular twin.
Do not skip the mattress pad; dorm room mattresses by themselves are not comfortable)
Toiletries (shower tote, towels, soap, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, shower sandals, bathrobe)
Storage (under-bed plastic tubs, laundry hamper, drawers.
Organizing your closet with a shoe rack or sweater organizer is always a good idea.)
Personal touches (posters, lamps, Christmas lights, knick-knacks)
Clothes (typically bring enough to last you three weeks without having to do laundry; you're not going to want to do laundry every weekend.
A wide variety is good as well so you're covered no matter what the weather is doing.
Remember to bring nice clothes you'd wear to a job interview because you never know if you'll need to look snazzy.
Necessary miscellaneous (fan, alarm clock, refrigerator (optional), bedside lamp, clip-on shelf for your bed frame, laptop, laundry detergent, umbrella)
Take this list to a trusted college graduate who can help you decide what you can do without.
