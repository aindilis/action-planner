If you have something else you want to talk about, write it in a different section at the bottom of the page.

Make sure you have the answers to all the questions that may be asked.
Research it if necessary.
At the end of the meeting, give each family member a piece of paper and a pencil and ask them to write their thoughts on the topic.
