attorney.Set the objectives of the training.
Ask yourself these questions to help set the right objective.Is it to train your employees on a new skill or to refresh them on things which they already know but don t perform too well on?
What do you plan to achieve after the training is done?
How are you going to assess if the training has met its objectives?
Who are you going to train ? Are the trainees new employees (which means they will be learning a whole new skill set) or old employees being refreshed on a certain skill set?
Once you have decided who needs to be trained and why, you then need to get suitable training material to suit the objectives of the training.
E.g. if you are going to train old employees in better customer service skills then you need to get a training program related to the kind of customer service you expect.
It s important to pick the right kind of training program as the success of your training depends on it.
You can either make your own training program or buy the material for your company.
Fix the schedule.
This is the next most important part of a training plan as it cost both time and money to train people.
You would have to see if people can be spared from their regular work to be trained.
If they are new employees then you need to check how long it is going to take to train them before they can start work.
It's better in the long run to make sure that all your employees are properly trained rather than spending lesser time in training them just to meet a day s or week s target.
If you want to train employees but cannot spare them from their everyday work then you may need to schedule the training time after or before work hours.
Of course this may not make the employees too happy.
