stress.See if there is another jurisdiction that looks at the same issue a different way.
For example, if you think that the income tax is a bad way to collect money to fund the government, is there another state that funds itself without an income tax?
Look at their legislation to determine what options are presently available.
Know what level of government is responsible for the law.
Is it a National law?
Then you might want to enlist the help of a Senator or Congressman.
Is it a state law?
Then a local assemblyman, or state house representative or a state senator is the person to see.
Finally if the law is a county or town ordinance seek out the local councilman, alderman, supervisor, mayor, or county executive.
See if there are any pending pieces of legislation that might accomplish the goal and are already in the legislative pipeline.
Book a meeting with your legislator, now that you're armed with a good idea about other pending legislation (or lack thereof) and examples of other ways governments handle your issue.
Meet with your legislator at his office if you can, rather than at a bar or restaurant, (or at the legislature's robing room.)
Your legislator will be more comfortable.
See the issue from the legislator's perspective.
When lobbying your legislator to change the law, you have to see how it matches the legislator's goals, values and constituents.
He/she is constantly being asked for things and often he has no idea about what the issue is about.
Bring information to leave for him and an extra copy for a staffer.
It is always good, after you have booked the meeting to send a thank you letter and explain in the letter a little about what your meeting will be about.
