environmentMake a list of daily and weekly tasks.
A bullet-form list is quick and easy to read and follow.
Be thorough and include extra tasks that may inevitably arise in your day.
It's best to be realistic.
Decide what's most important.
Some tasks may have priority, such as making a meal, doing homework or keeping an appointment.
Divide tasks throughout the week or month.
Give yourself additional time to relax.
Get plenty of sleep to think more clearly and creatively.
Leave time to do work that is not a priority.
Set aside time to take care of anything unexpected.
Some things take a little longer than anticipated.
Leave time for error.
Accomplish small tasks.
Break down your more time-consuming tasks into smaller increments.
Do your math homework in two half hour sessions, taking a break in between.
Have fun in between chores.
This creates less stress with a more reasonable use of your time.
Stay focused.
Try not to start a new project until a previous project has been completed.
Concentrate on one thing at a time and do it well.
Write "Focus on Priority" on post-it notes.
Keep them near the phone, computer or on the refrigerator to remind yourself.
Review your progress.
Sit back and look over your work.
Have you progressed as far as you should?
Is there a more efficient way to accomplish what you're doing?
Reassign portions of your project to another day.
Delegate to others, if needed.
Be flexible.
Try to complete your projects, but if unable to do so, complete them up to a certain point and leave them for another day.
