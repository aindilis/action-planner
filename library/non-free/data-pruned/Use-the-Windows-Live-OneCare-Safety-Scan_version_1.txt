hobbiesMicrosoft wants to sell you Windows Live One Care, and it is best to have real-time security, but the Microsoft website also offers a free scan and cleaning.
Even though you certainly have an anti-malware program, an occasional scan with this program will clean up what slips past your installed program.
The process can take a long time, especially if it has been awhile since your last scan, so be prepared to leave your computer on for a few hours.
If you use a laptop, keep it plugged in; your battery is not likely to maintain power for the necessary time.
In an Internet Explorer window*, go to http ://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm.
You will see a button offering a Full Service Scan.
Click it.
Disable your pop-up blocker (usually done by holding down the CTRL button while you click) and click Install Now.
Click Launch Scanner.
Make sure Complete Scan is checked, then click Next.
Read a book, or do your chores.
Keep your computer on and online.
Every so often, stop by and see if the scan is finished.
After the scan is finished, a menu will ask you what to do with what it found.
Check off what you want removed, and make sure software you installed is not checked.
Click Next.
