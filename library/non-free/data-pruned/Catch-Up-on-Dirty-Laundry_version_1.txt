holes.Find a large area to sort clothes.
Move furniture out of the way, if you must.
If you can take over a bed or table for sorting, do so.
Gather all the laundry into this area.
This includes bed and bath linens, dishtowels, slip covers, etc.
Prioritize sorting into piles.
Start with underwear, socks, and work clothes as top-priority items.
Then come favorite items that you wear frequently.
If you don't have clean linens for bed and bath to replace the dirty ones, go ahead and prioritize them too.
De-prioritize the following into piles : Clothes that don't fit, off-season clothes, clothes that need repair, clothes you wear only when nothing else is handy.
Don't forget to come back to these piles.
Mend an item if it's a favorite.
Get rid of it if it doesn't fit or flatter.
If you have a lot of things in this category, chances are that they're just getting in your way, jamming up your drawers and closets, making it harder to put away and find what you do wear.
Throw away underwear and socks if they have holes or hopeless stains.
Place all these piles into manageable bags that each contain only enough clothes to fill a washing machine.
You may need to prioritize the "priority bags," depending on how many piles you have.
