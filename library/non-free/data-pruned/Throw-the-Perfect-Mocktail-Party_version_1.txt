on.Choose a theme.
A theme doesn't mean that people have to dress up (but that is fun too).
For this example let's choose a Tiki/Polynisian theme.
Margaritas are easy.
Usecups of frozen strawberries (buy the large bags, especially from a warehouse store), 4 cups of ice, 1 cup of strawberry margarita mix, and 1 Tablespoon of lime juice.
Put it all in the blender and fire it up.
You can add more juice or more ice if the texture isn't right.
For Pina Colada usecup of coconut milk, 2 cups of pineapple juice, and 4 cups of ice.
Mix together in the blender until smooth.
Tiki Punch uses a special ingredient for effect.
Check your local supermarket or look in your yellow pages for ice companies and purchase a small block of dry ice (please follow all precautions for dry ice it can burn you if you touch it).
You will need:can frozen orange juice, one can frozen apple/raspberry juice and 3 bottles of sparkling apple juice.
In a large punch bowl, mix the frozen juices and only one bottle of apple juice, so you don't waste the fizz.
Add the other bottles right before the party starts.
Now for the fun: drop small pieces of dry ice into the punch bowl.
The punch will bubble and smoke and give a great appearance.
