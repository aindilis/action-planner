lapsChoose your target group.
Depending on the group that you are organizing for, this may be children in school, the parents of school children, local businesses, or the general public.
You may want to sell candy or donuts to the children, but advertising or services to businesses.
By picking the best possible "product" for your fundraising effort, you will increase your chance to succeed.
Think about cost.
If you decide to make it a public fundraising event, think about cost, sponsorship, and participation.
An example would be a car wash, which is a very common fundraiser for youth groups and clubs.
Cost would include soap, washcloths, and use of a facility to hold the event.
Sponsorship could come in the form of a local retailer who is willing to let you use their premises and water for the event, and possibly help with advertising.
Participation is getting the members of your club or group to be at the location, willing to work, as well as having them help spread the word prior to the event.
Pick a suitable time and date.
Carwashes, cookouts, and yard sales are more profitable and enjoyable in good weather, so they may not be suitable for mid winter or the middle of summer in very hot locations.
Attendance will be higher on Saturdays, but look at the community calendar to be sure no other event is planned for the day you choose that will have people busy doing other things while you are holding your fundraiser.
Find a good location.
Many retail businesses allow different groups to use their premises for car washes, bake sales, and other fundraising activities if they are compatible with their values and they support what you are working for.
Advertise.
This can mean placing signs around town and at community bulletin boards, word of mouth, or talking to broadcast media to see what type of advertising they offer.
Many radio stations and local television outlets have community bulletin boards and public service announcements for non profit groups.
