vacuumHamperTake your clothes out of the closet and make a pile of them on the floor.
This will make it easier to take the clothes.
Now you can just grab the clothes and try them instead of pulling them out of the closet.
Try on the pants first.
If something is too big or too loose, see if it is adjustable.
If it isn't, you got three choices.
Give your younger brother or sister new hand-me-downs, donate to charity, or just throw them out.
Try on the shirts next.
Do the same things you did with the pants except you don't need to check for if it's adjustable.
Most shirts don't have that feature.
Now, try on hair stuff.
Maybe headbands.
If they hurt your head, get rid of them.
If they keep falling off, get rid of them too.
You also should check if they make you look crazy, just in case...
Check on personals.
You all know what we mean.
Bras, underwear, that kind of stuff.
Again, if they don't fit, just get rid of them.
Don't worry about the way they look.
No one's going to see them.
Put any seasonal stuff back in your closet, as clean-up.
This is so whenever you need to get something, you will always see something good in your closet.
Wear shoes that you will likely wear with whatever you're trying on.
If you try on pants with athletic shoes on but intend to wear them with heels, you might find that they are too short later on.
Think about how the clothing can be tailored.
If something doesn't fit quite right, a tailor might be able to fix that for just a few dollars.
Practice good hygiene.
If trying on any kind of underwear or bathing suits, keep your own underwear on underneath.
You never know who tried it on before you!
