friend(s)!Get several soft pillows--enough for all your friends-- and put them in your bedroom (Make sure your friends don't see you).
Lead your friends into your bedroom and make small talk.
Sit on the bed or on the floor, put your (own) pillow into your lap and start casually playing with it.
Wait for a slight pause in the conversation.
Leave the pillow on the bed or floor, and stand up and stretch.
Make sure everybody is watching you or at least paying attention to you.
When you're done stretching, remain standing up, and squeeze your pillow a bit.
Look at your friends, wait for 1-2 seconds, take a deep breath and yell "PILLOW FIGHT !" While you are yelling that draw back your pillow and bop someone with it.
Your friends will grab the other pillows and join the fight.
