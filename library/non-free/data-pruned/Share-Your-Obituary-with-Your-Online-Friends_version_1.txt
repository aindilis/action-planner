time.Identify the representative who will handle your affairs after your death.
This could be a spouse, a child, a parent, an attorney, or even a neighbor.
Let your representative know that you are active online and that you want him to notify your online friends after you pass away.
Make a list of people with whom you correspond online.
Go through your e-mail address book and think about who you would like to have notified after you pass on and how.
Leave specific instructions for your representative, such as:
How to log into your e-mail account
Send a specific message to certain people
Send a general message to everyone in the address book
Set up an automatic reply to anyone who writes to your e-mail address
Delete the account after a specified period of time has passed
Identify now any online communities of which you are an active member.
Are you a regular contributor?
Surely other users will appreciate being notified after your death.
Maybe you are a read-only member.
Nonetheless, you may still want to have the group notified after your death if you feel the group has helped you and you want to express your appreciation.
Write down full instructions as to how to access your communities.
List the name of the group or service sponsoring the online community, the URL or website address or, if the group is accessed by posting an email, give the appropriate email address.
Ascertain how your representative will be able to log in to the community.
Can he simply email an administrator?
Will he have to create his own account and log on in order to send a message?
Work this out now so that you can give full instructions which you know are going to work later, when your representative tries to notify the group.
