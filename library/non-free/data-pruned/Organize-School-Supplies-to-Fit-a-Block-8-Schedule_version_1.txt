shelfIf you're required to have one binder per class, make sure to switch them out per day.
After an A day, take out your notebooks during homework time and go ahead and put the B day binder in, and vice versa.
If you can combine classes in one binder, DO IT ! Get one 2-4" binder for each day, depending on your classes.
Now would be the time to watch color coding.
If you need one binder per class, make each class a different color.
If you only need two, make A-day one color and B-day another.
No matter what color your notebooks are, get highlighters, book covers, stickers, ANYTHING, in the same color.
That way you can look at a glance and see what you need what day.
Get a pencil pouch (the kind and snaps in your binder rings) for each binder.
Put two pencils, two black pens, two red pens, highlighters, etc. in this pouch for quick and easy access.
Dividing the binders : For the one binder per class approach, merely get any kind of divider you please and divide sections for note, homework, classwork, etc. If you're using two binders, get two types of dividers (I use pocket dividers and small tab ones).
Use one type to separate the classes, and use the other to put your classes in different sections (note, homework, etc.)
