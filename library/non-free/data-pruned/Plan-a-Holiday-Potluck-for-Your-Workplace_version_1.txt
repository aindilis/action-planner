With the approval of your boss, schedule the potluck during regular business hours.
Mention in the invitation that the event is for staff only and not families unless you have a lot of space.
Adjust your invitation as needed to include interns or key volunteers.
Check with the management of your office and determine if any holiday festivities have been scheduled.
Even if an off-site holiday party is scheduled, an in-house potluck may allow more people to
attend.Ask permission to schedule a potluck at the office and coordinate the best time and location to set up and have the meal.
Depending on when your offices are open, a lunchtime potluck meal may be the best time.
More employees are typically in the office during the
day.Ask your manager if the company can cover the cost of the meat items, allowing employees to bring the fixings.
If not, ask everyone to contribute a dollar or two in addition to their potluck contribution.
Order the meats in advance from a restaurant, grocer, deli,
etc.Because of the cost involved and concerns about proper cooking, you may want to consider ordering hams or turkeys from a local restaurant, grocer or deli.
You can pick them up before the meal and serve while it is still warm.
The meats usually take the longest time and having them prepared by a professional is usually easiest.
Consider ordering pre-cut turkey breasts and ham to offer a variety with easy
serving.Tofurkey or other meat substitutes should also be considered if you have vegetarians on staff.
Don't assume they'll be fine with the side dishes.
These are quick to prepare and may be a good item for your vegetarian co-workers to sign up to bring.
Consider adding a "meat substitute" line to your sign up sheet if vegetarians are numerous in your
workplace.
You don't have to send out fancy invitations, just send a festive and friendly email.
Use holiday printer paper for your signs or add some clip art.
Pick a date and time.
Consider the demands of your industry.
Retail businesses may need to schedule this when the location is less busy.
Other offices may have many people taking their vacation the week of Christmas.
Consider a time earlier in the month of December if your office tends to operate on a skeleton crew the week of
Christmas.Ask the highest ranking manager to send an email to all employees asking them to save the date and time and inviting them to celebrate with co-workers.
Reminder emails should be sent out weekly leading up to the date.
Send the initial email out as far in advance as possible.
Two weeks in advance is adequate for smaller
offices.A message from the most senior manager is usually best and will probably result in a better turn
out.Managers can coordinate a system with their staffers to allow everyone a chance to get food and
eat.Post signs around the office with the date and time.
Also instruct people to a specific location to sign up to bring certain dishes.
Place the sign up sheet in a central location where people will see it every
day.
Encourage people to bring their favorite or most popular holiday dish.
With a diverse group of co-workers, you may end up with a wonderful and flavorful variety for your potluck.
Create a sign up sheet for people to commit to bringing certain
items.Tape the sign up sheet to someone's desk in a central location.
You don't want the sign up mixed up or accidentally thrown
away.Include another sheet with the details of the event and a separate sheet for a few volunteers to sign up.
Volunteers will be needed to set up the food, put ice in coolers, etc. For a larger workplace, you may want to have a sign up sheet for "Set Up Volunteers" and "Clean Up Volunteers".
Consider the size of your office when adding the numbered lines.
If you only havepeople in your office, you may want to only put a few lines under each food
category.By limiting the number of items under each category you can be sure you will have enough of the appropriate food items and not,000 paper plates and bags of ice but nothing to
eat.Include a deadline to sign up and remove the sheet at the deadline.
This will encourage people to sign up the weeks before and not for something atpm the night before.
One or two business days before is usually
sufficient.Consider the following categories and layout to add to your sign up sheet(s).
Other items may be considered depending on what may be popular locally.
Adjust for the size of your office.
Have them write their name and what they are bringing.
(Example: John Doe - Candied Yams)

________________Remind everyone to bring the appropriate serving spoons to serve their dish.
People bringing desserts should bring pie servers or a sharp knife.
Let them know on the sign up sheet and through emails and memos to bring the appropriate serving spoons to go with their dish.
People bringing canned foods (cranberry sauce) may need to bring a manual can opener if your office kitchen or break area doesn't have
one.
Add some simple decorations but don't clutter the area.
You can borrow decorations from other parts of your office for the party.
Festive but disposable table cloths, cups, etc. can add to the holiday feel.
Tell them to drop off their dishes.Include a notation on the sign up sheet asking everyone to bring their dishes to the area/room it will be served at least-45 minutes prior to the meal time.
Those with non-perishables can place them in the room as they arrive in the morning.
This will get all the food and serving ware into the right room where the volunteers can set it up.
Also include a notation that everyone is responsible for collecting their dirty dishes following the potluck
.Set up large garbage cans to collect dirty dishes and cups.
This will prevent food dishes from being tossed into waste paper baskets that may not have liners.
You may need to move garbage cans from other parts of the building or coordinate with the cleaning service to have the large cans and heavy duty liners available.
If your office and staff is working to be more "green" you should request specific environmentally friendly plates, cups and cutlery be purchased.
Make sure you have a separate recycling container next to the
trash.To stay super green, ask everyone to bring their own plates, cups and utensils from
home.Remind everyone to label their dishes, slow cookers or serving items.
Keep a roll of masking tape in the drop off area in case someone
forgets.Make sure you have dish detergent at a sink where people may rinse off items before taking home.
If a sink is not available, people may want to bring a plastic bag to safely transport the dirty dishes back home for
cleaning.
Warm dishes can be transported in insulated containers to keep the food at a serving temperature.
Your office kitchen may not be conducive to many people trying to re-warm dishes.
Encourage people to bring hot items in insulated carriers or to have someone warm the dish at home.
Having everyone with hot dishes trying to warm food in the microwave could be problematic and delay the start time of your meal.
Electric griddles are an excellent way to keep items warm when you use them on the lowest setting, monitor often and stir as
needed.Some potluck recipes are excellent when served in a slow cooker.
They are easy to transport and you can be plugged in when you arrive at the office so the food stays
warm.Have tables set up near plugs to keep slow cookers and other electric serving items can be plugged
in.Coordinate with your potluck volunteers so they arrive about an hour before meal time and you can begin setting up prior to the designated meal time.
Wipe off any tables that will be used for serving
food.Set the plates, cutlery and napkins at the beginning of the food line, place the meats next followed by the side dishes.
Place drinks and desserts and the end of the table or set up another table for those
items.If the dish isn't obvious, the dish bringer can label the dish with the name of the food and also make a notation if there are nuts, or meats mixed in.
Just a "____ casserole-has nuts" or "pasta salad-has bacon" will do.
The mention of nuts is especially important if someone in your office has a nut allergy.
The mention of meat is nice for vegetarians , especially when a meat or broth may be mixed in and not obvious at first glance.
Label the dish or tape the note to it.
Taping the note to the table may not work since dishes may get moved around as people are serving
themselves.Coordinate with the manager a time for him/her to address the group.
This is usually best as people are gathering but before everyone has served themselves and is moving to find a seat.
If you have someone who can say a few words giving thanks, coordinate with them before.
They can be ready to make those remarks as the manager
finishes.Allow those workers with limited time to eat to go first in line.
These may be co-workers who have duties that are being temporarily covered by someone
else.Enjoy this opportunity to share great food and spend time with your
co-workers.Give everyone plenty of time to go through and eat.
Encourage people to get seconds or save leftovers on plates for any shift workers that may not be awake to attend.
Label these and put in the refrigerator.
They'll love the
thought.Remind everyone to claim their dishes and serving items.
Hopefully, most people will come to collect those items and the volunteers won't be delivering bowls and platters to
