of!Set a budget.
Deciding how much money you want to spend on your honeymoon will allow you to narrow down your choices.
Remember that traveling outside of the United States may cost a lot more than traveling somewhere within the country.
Talk to your partner.
Figure out exactly what you want out of your honeymoon.
Do you want to do a lot of activities?
If so, maybe plan on a cruise.
Do you just want to relax on the beach?
If so, consider a resort of some kind.
You may both want to explore, so maybe you'd like to go to Europe and take a train trip to several countries.
Make sure you're on the same page so you're both happy on your perfect honeymoon.
Figure out your timeline.
Will you be leaving the day after the wedding?
Or do you want to spend a week at home before traveling to a faraway honeymoon?
You may want to save the honeymoon and go on it a year after the wedding.
You'll need to figure this out right away, so you know how much time you have to prepare.
Decide on a destination.
There are many different warmer countries you can go to if you want to sit by the ocean every day of your honeymoon.
Make sure to check the weather; you don't want to end up somewhere right in the middle of hurricane season.
Check out different resorts and hotels.
Once you know where you want to go, you'll need to find a place to stay.
If you're going to a tropical location, consider looking into an all-inclusive resort.
Depending on the time of year, you can find good deals at different locations.
An all-inclusive will include all of your meals, gratuity and your alcoholic beverages, while a cruise will include all of your food, but you'll have to pay for any alcohol, as well as tip specific people on board the ship.
Set up a honeymoon registry instead of a traditional registry.
Your guests can contribute to your honeymoon fund and that's less that you have to pay for in the end.
