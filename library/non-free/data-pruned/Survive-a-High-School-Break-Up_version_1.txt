drawing.Remember, that it may feel like the end of the world but it isn't.
It's high school drama, which is so not like High School Musical.
And yes, it will feel like the world is collapsing and your heart has just been ripped out.
But you'll survive.
Cry.
After the crying is done, sit quietly and rethink everything that happened.
I'm talking, the reasons why you two broke up.
Write.
You might find that writing in a journal or a diary helps.
Try writing down a simple and honest 'pros and cons' list.
List all the great things about the relationship and all the not so great things.
Remember to be honest, your writing this to yourself.
Be sure to include how other people feel about the relationship, like your parents, your friends, how are your grades?
Did they dip when you started dating?
[that's a 'con']
Talk to your buddies.
Remember, you probably had a bunch of buddies, or at least one or two good friends prior to dating, contact them for a good laugh and to redirect your feelings and attention to someone else.
Get active.
Go walking, play a sport, workout.
Get your blood flowing and some sweat going, again, to redirect the ' break up ' energy and to do something good for yourself.
Besides, your back on the high school market now, who knows who will come walking into your life next.
Breathe . Breathing space.
Leave the one who broke up with you alone.
Remember, "No means no." If this person wants to breakup with you, hey, that's their loss.
You are a strong, great person, who will find your Mr. or Ms. right.
The last thing you want is to check out his or her Myspace and see that they feel 'stalked'.
Besides, you've got to concentrate on you now.
