hotels.Opaque travel sites like Hotwire.com offer the best deals, but the downside is that you don't know what hotel you are getting until you buy.
There is a way around this, however; http://hotspyer.com has a database of hotels that are listed on Hotwire and you can match the listings in order to figure out which hotel you are getting before you buy.
Search for hotel deals on major travel sites like HotGuzzi.com, Travelocity, Priceline, etc. You can even compare hotels within each site by checking the box next to hotels you like and then clicking on 'Compare' button.
This way, you will have page view of three hotels side-by-side that you can also print for later review.
Some hotels do not include free internet, breakfast etc. That can be seen using this 'Compare' feature.
Go directly to the hotel's website.
Investigate the prices on the site.
Do they have any specials currently being advertised?
Sign up to be notified of any specials by email.
Note the prices for the date you are interest in.
Call the hotel directly.
Tell them you are interested in getting a good deal.
Make them aware of any discounts you might qualify.
This would include automobile association cards, senior rates, entertainment cards, business traveler rates, government rates etc.
Use any flexibility you might have.
If you are flexible about the date of your stay, also investigate different days of the week or an alternate week.
Book.
After you have all of this information, now you can book your room and be confident that you are getting the best rate possible.
