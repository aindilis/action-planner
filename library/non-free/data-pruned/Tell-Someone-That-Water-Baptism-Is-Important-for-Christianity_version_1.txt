Set aside some time to go through some scriptures with this person.
Explain to the person that water baptism is important for many reasons in The Bible which you will now look at.
Show the person that one of the most compelling reasons for water baptism was that in the book of acts when Christ was preached the people responded by being baptised in water.
(See Acts 16:13-15, Acts 16:31-33, Acts 8:12, Acts 8:36, Acts 18:4-8, Acts 2;41 ) So obviously, in Bible times water baptism was part of the message when preaching Christ.
Show the person how, according to The Bible, water baptism leads to Holy Spirit baptism.
(See Acts 2:38, Acts 19:1-6 ) Also known as "preparing the way of the Lord" as John the Baptist's teachings of water baptism unto repentance was referred to like that...
(See Matthew 3:3&11, Luke 3:4&16 )
Show the person that even if Holy Spirit baptism comes first water baptism should follow.
(See Acts 10:46 )
Show the person how Jesus tells his disciples of the importance of baptism at the end of the gospels of Mark and Matthew, in His last words before He ascended into heaven.
( See Matthew 28:18, Mark 16:16 )
Show the person that Peter repeats this instruction to be baptised at the beginning of the Christian Church ( See Acts 2 :38 )
Show the person that Paul taught that water baptism was our way of identifying with the death of Jesus Christ.
( See Romans 6:4, Colossians 2:12 )
Show the person that the stories of Noah and the flood and the opening of the Red sea are Old testament examples of water baptism ( See 1 Peter 3 :20-21, 1 Corinthians 10:2 ) symbolising the removal of the old and the start of a new life.
Show the person that Jesus' baptism was for 2 main reasons to fulfill righteousness before God -- that is it was the right thing to do, and for our example -- that we should follow at an age of understanding.
( See Matthew 3:13-16, Luke 3:21-22, Mark 1:8-10, 1 Peter 2:21, 1 Thessalonians 1:6 )
Show the person that those who were baptised justified God, ie : agreed/verified that He is right -- and those who rejected baptism rejected God's plan ( See Luke 7:29 & 30 ):
"And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him."
Show the person the person that baptism is a public symbol of personal repentance toward God.
( See Acts 2:38, Matthew 3:11, Acts 19:4, 1 Peter3:21 )
Show the person that in The Bible those who gladly received His word were baptised.
( See Acts 2:41 ) Then compare to John 1:1-12 and see that receiving His word is synonymous with receiving Jesus.
Show the person that baptism is of enough importance that it should be done again, if it was done for the wrong reason (or in the wrong way) the first time.
( See Acts 19:2-6 )
Show the person that water baptism in The Bible should be done as soon as possible after a person had repented.
( See Acts 22:16 )
Show the person that that in The Bible water baptism was always done by full immersion.
( See Matthew 3:16, John 3:23, Acts 8:38 )
Show the person that believing or repentance should precede baptism so therefore the person needs to be of an age to understand what believing and repentance is.
( See Acts 2:38, Mark 16:16, Matthew 28:19 )
