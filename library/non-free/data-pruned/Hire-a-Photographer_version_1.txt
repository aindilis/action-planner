to.Talk to your friends first.
The best way to find a photographer is through word of mouth.
A referral from a friend or family who has used this photographer before will be the most re-assuring for you as you will already have a testimony of their work from a trusted source.
Try a search engine.
Type in "photographers in Scranton, Pennsylvania" (but insert your own home town).
Be specific to get the best results.
"Wedding photographers", for example.
Many established photographers with current up to date work will have a listing online or a website.
But sometimes, even an internet search can turn up nothing.
Your local business chamber of commerce may have some listings or referrals.
Wedding coordinators or event planners may be able to refer someone to you as well.
Plan to meet with your photographer in person before agreeing to hire them or exchange any payment of services.
For a large wedding or event, there should be a contract.
This will protect you and it protects the photographer.
Most professional photographers will have a contract that simply outlines the service they provide and the terms of payment.
Read the fine print and get a clear understanding of what is expected should you cancel before hand.
Ask to see examples of the photographers work.
Make sure you see several examples, not just one.
Viewing pictures they have taken is a way for you to see their photography style and their editing process.
Photography is a perspective of the person behind the lense.
They may see the world differently than you do.
It is important that the photographer match your style and capture the world in a picture in a way you like and find appealing.
