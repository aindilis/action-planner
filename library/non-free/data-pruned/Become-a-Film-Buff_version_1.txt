you.Purchase a film guide.
There are many available online or at bookstores.
You can start with Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin if you wish, but if you really want to be familiar with more obscure films, try something more comprehensive.
The Time-Out Film Guide is a great resource, and it's widely available.
Scan the guide, the summaries, and the commentaries.
Don't look for exciting plots or melodrama, but rather see what the aesthetic appeals of the film are: visual beauty, quality of acting, screenplay, the film's overall meaning and depth, etc.
Watch more films.
Even ones that look only mildly interesting.
Sometimes they surprise you.
Don t limit yourself to one or two movie genres; you will be the best if you have seen a good number of movies with a variety of themes.
Be sure to include both current films playing in theatres, as well as films released on DVDs and video tapes.
Be sure to include older movies and foreign films, too; there can be some gems among both categories.
Purchase more films.
You can watch movies as many times as you wish if you own them.
Repeated viewings allow you to see things in the film that you may have missed the first time that you watched it.
Details are often lost when you are trying to take the film in for the first time.
Watching for details can help you familiarize yourself with directors' trademarks, and they give the film more meaning.
Check the Internet for some info or trivia that you may have missed.
Wikipedia is a great resource, but a very comprehensive one solely devoted to films is the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB), which has cast, crew, production staff, and technical listings; plot summaries; links to major reviews in newspapers, magazines, and online sources; and lots of trivia and memorable quotes about each film listed.
IMDB now has parental advisory content in case you plan on taking your kid(s) to a movie.
