life.Take a plastic disposable container (like one of those reusable soup/sandwich containers made by hefty or ziploc).
Make sure it's one you don't want anymore because you will end up throwing it away in the end.
Fill it with something the pincher bugs will love such as olive or vegetable oil about 2 inches deep.
Place the container near where you see earwigs frequently.
Wait overnight.
