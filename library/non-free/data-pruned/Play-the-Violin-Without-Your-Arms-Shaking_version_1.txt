memory'.Practice and play your instrument.
The more you play, the less your arms should shake.
It's only natural that your technique improves with time.
Do exercises with your bow.
Move your bow back and forth on the strings slowly trying to maintain a steady sound that doesn't become louder or quieter.
Using an open string is a good idea because it will let you focus on your right arm and not worry about your fingers.
Improve your vibrato.
Better vibrato will also equal less arm shaking.
