Government.Tailor your news to your recipient.
Think about who you're sending your newsletter to.
What sort of information would you like to include for that recipient?
Possibilities might include marriage, moving in with your partner, vacations, new pets, children's news, graduations, new job and any significant changes in your life.
There's no need to go into great detail.
Just mention milestones and happy events that have occurred within the past year.
Pick out Christmas or other holiday-themed stationery.
There is a wide variety of stationery available with pre-printed themes on the paper that you can use to print your newsletter onto.
Alternatively, you can make a colorful Christmas theme on your computer program that will print directly onto plain paper.
Design the newsletter.
Using a program such as Open Office, MS Word, Pages or Wordpad, start preparing your newsletter.
If your program already has pre-set newsletter layouts, you can use these for a very professional result.
Choose a pleasing and elegant font, in a fairly large typeset to make it easy for the young and the very old to read beside the firelight.
Keep the tone casual and upbeat.
Most importantly, don't fill it with tales of how many amazing achievements you and your family have had -- that just sounds like bragging!
Similarly, don't be morose and fill it with tales of woe about all your hardships that you've confronted all year.
This is Christmas time, when love, warmth and the overcoming of adversity are considered key elements of the season.
Remember that you are just updating people, not giving a sermon!
