further.Decide on a hotel.
Does it fit the travel budget?
Is there any extra cost to having kids share a room?
What type of room is needed?
All are questions that should be answered when renting a hotel room.
Search for hotel deals on major travel sites like HotGuzzi.com, Travelocity, Priceline, etc. You can even compare hotels within each site by checking the box next to hotels you like and then clicking on 'Compare' button.
This way, you will have page view of three hotels side-by-side that you can also print for later review.
Some hotels do not include free internet, breakfast etc. That can be seen using the 'Compare' feature.
Check the hotel web site, if available, or check travel web sites for hotel reviews.
Check with your travel agent about the accommodations.
Call the hotel directly.
While you may get a better deal on discount travel web sites, they probably won't tell you about exclusive special deals.
Make sure you politely ask if they have discounts, and they will tell you if they have or not.
Ask the clerk any questions you might have when making the hotel reservation.
If you get it done now, you won't get frustrated later.
You may need to ask about parking, pets, smoking, if it is on a steep hill, etc.
Request an information packet or brochure about the hotel, to ensure that you know exactly what to expect.
Confirm the reservation and write down the reservation number.
