it.Realize that you are not alone and that many people have gone through this; the surgeons, nurses, and therapists know what they are doing and how to do it.
What happens happens, in the end it all makes you a better person.
Just do your part to make this turn out for the best, no matter what.
Let your parents and friends know how you are feeling.
It will help them to understand what you are going through.
Accept the fact that you won't be able to do a lot of things your friends can't.
You won't be able to ride in a car for long periods of time, sit up for over an hour, or even walk more than a mile.
Remember, even if you have a bad day every now and then, it gets better.
