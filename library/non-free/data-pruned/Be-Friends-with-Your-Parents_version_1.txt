residence.Treat your parents the best way in which you can.
Treat your parents the way you want them to treat you.
If you want them to listen to you, then listen to what they have to say.
Giving respect gains respect.
Do something social with your parents and get to know who they are as people.
Just as you might try a sport with a new friend, why not join your parents in their hobbies and let them take part in yours?
Don't take advantage.
Children (and sometimes adults) often see parents as a bank clerks, chefs, or house keepers.
Instead of letting your parents do everything for you, share in tasks and be responsible for your actions.
Take part in family activities, such as birthdays or visiting elderly relatives.
Doing things together makes relationships stronger.
If your parents are both alike, make sure to get one-on-one time with each of them, not just time with them as a couple.
It's a good way to break down old habits and styles of interaction; plus, it's more intimate.
You may find that a parent opens up to you more, or opens up in different ways, when the other parent isn't present.
Agree upon areas where you are open to suggestions and ideas from them.
Inform them "politely and diplomatically" the issues which you are not comfortable talking/sharing with them.
Do something special for your parents.
Sometimes, showing mutual appreciation is the best way to build and maintain relationships.
Communicate ! If you act ashamed of them when your friends are around, how do you think they feel?
If you chew their face off because they call you to see if you'd like something, how you're doing, or what you'd like for dinner, do you think they'll be friendly for long?
