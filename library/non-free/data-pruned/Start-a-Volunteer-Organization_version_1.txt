risk.Discuss your idea with friends.
Friends are usually pretty supportive, and if you talk to a friend that feels the same way you do, or even one that's already a volunteer, they can give you some good advice.
Plan.
After getting some support and advice, just plan out what you're going to do with the organization.
Where will meetings be held?
In which ways can you volunteer?
If you aren't having meetings, how will you deliver information?
Write your aim.
The aim is a plan of your goals in general to help members understand what they are trying to achieve.
This would be an example of an aim.
Write rules and limitations.
Who can and can't join?
How do you start a project?
What can and can't be said?
All of those things are important to know.
If you and nobody else knows the rules, the whole system goes haywire.
Delegate tasks to willing members.
Devise a system for exchange of ideas.
You could have meetings, you could have a website, you could have a blog, or you can have a newsletter.
Those are just examples.
Going beyond those is fine.
People will have to know what you're doing in order to join or go and do it on a planned date.
