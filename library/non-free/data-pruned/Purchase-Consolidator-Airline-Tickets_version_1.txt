seats!Plan your travel ahead of time but be flexible on exact dates and flights.
If price is your number-one priority, booking consolidator airplane tickets can save you money.
Work with a travel professional.
A travel agent is the best way to purchase tickets from a reputable consolidator.
Travel agents who deal with consolidator tickets will have a list of consolidators they work with on a consistent basis so they know who is reputable and who is not.
Although they may add a slight mark-up to the ticket, the price you pay will be less than anywhere else you purchase the tickets.
Plus, if you have a problem with flight delays or cancellations, you have a person to contact.
Examine the travel section of your local newspaper, especially the Sunday edition, for advertisements from airline ticket consolidators who sell to the public.
