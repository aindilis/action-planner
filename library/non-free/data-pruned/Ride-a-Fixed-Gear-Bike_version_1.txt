mess.Get a fixed gear : The best way is to build bikes from old "10 speed" bikes, which is generally the least expensive and most "customizable" approach.
Make sure the frame has either diagonal horizontal dropouts-- vertical dropouts don't allow for adjustment or chain flex, and are generally a poor choice for single- or- fixed-gear conversions.
Though you can make things work by getting creative with a dremmel and a half-link.
Alternatives are new bikes like Giant's "track" or Bianchi's "Pista".
If you spend over $500 you may well be missing the point.
You will need to make decisions on what size gear to use and whether you wish to add a front or rear brake -"very low 70's gearing" and "front brake only" are typical decisions.
Or you can buy a decent, inexpensive track frame and build it up with quality parts.
Those store bought fixies often are a hodgepodege of parts, some of which are garbage.
"Just keep turning the pedals".
Sounds obvious but if you do not control the bike, it will control you, with unpleasant consequences.
It is not as obvious as it sounds.
It will take quite a while for your subconscious mind to learn not to try coasting, and not to feel like a runaway locomotive when you discover you can't.
Practice random acts of senseless stopping.
Depending on whether you have chosen to use brakes, this may require a lot more time and - or mastery of "skid stopping".
At the very least it will entail trying to "back-pedal" to slow down, which you may find an interesting challenge.
If you can't learn to slow yourself down or stop, get off the bike.
You could seriously hurt yourself or get killed.
Leave the bike computer and heart rate monitor at home.
The point is to simplify things to where we can enjoy riding as we did when we were children.
