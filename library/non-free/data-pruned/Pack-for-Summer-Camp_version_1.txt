Be realistic and lean towards a larger amount of items than you might think you'll need.
Nearly all camps send out a list to families giving instructions on what things to pack, and how many will be needed.
It's essential to bring what the camp requires, but extra would definitely not hurt.
Note the quantity of all items you are bringing ("Pillows, 2; T-shirts, 12"; etc.)
Shop for any camp items you don't already have, preferably about two or three weeks before you go.
Be prepared to visit several different stores and spend an uncomfortable amount of money, depending on what you may still need.
Gather everything you wish to bring and pack them tightly and neatly in your suitcase, trunk, box, or duffel bag.
You will very likely need more than one container to hold all your things.
Consider leaving smaller, portable items at home and instead taking them in a backpack when you travel to camp.
Prevent your items from getting lost by labeling everything with your name and assigned cabin.
There is no other way to make sure your things end up back with their rightful owner at the end of the summer.
Check off everything on the list to make sure you have it before leaving.
If you arrive home and find that something is missing, the list will help you know what to replace, or possibly get back from other campers who took it home by accident.
