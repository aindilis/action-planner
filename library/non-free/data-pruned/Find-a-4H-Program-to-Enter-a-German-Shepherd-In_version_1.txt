store)Contact or visit your local extension office or county fair office and ask them for a list of that county's 4H clubs.
Typically they will be organized into subject order, and you typically want to join a club that specializes in dogs or pets.
If you can't find any, move on the next county.
If you still fail to find any, you can probably join any club.
Though they will not be as knowledgeable in such areas, you will still be able to show.
When you find your potential club, there should be a contact number included.
Ask for meeting times, more contact information, the advisors, and any additional information that is important.
If there isn't a contact number included, talk to the extension office or fair office and ask them for one.
You will probably need a project title and book if showing through traditional 4H, which can be purchased through the 4H handbook and family guide (your advisors should provide them).
