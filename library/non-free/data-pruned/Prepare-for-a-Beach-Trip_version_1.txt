itemsPrior to going to the beach, you may want to get highlights in your hair, buy a new swimsuit,new flip flops and get a light tan to make you look your best at the beach.
Figure out how much stuff you plan on bringing with you to the beach.
This will determine the size of your beach bag ; as you don't want a big bag to carry around, but have small stuff in there and you don't want a small purse when you have a lot of stuff to carry.
Cheap beach bags can be found at Target and Wal-Mart.
Pick out an extra set of clothes and your beach clothes.
Pick out airy and light colored swimsuits to avoid absorbing the sun's rays or surf shorts that fit comfortably.
You may elect to leave your extra clothes in your car or hotel room (if applicable).
Some beaches have public pavilions, which include restrooms , lockers , and showers.
Leaving it in the car helps so that you won't get more clothes covered in sand.
Flip flops or slippers are great for walking in, but when you get to the sand, take them off to avoid flinging sand at others.
Also, if you are planning to walk along the shoreline, go barefoot to avoid additional and unnecessary water splashing.
Use beach protection every time you go there.
Bring chapstick with SPF to prevent your lips from burning and chapping.
Also, bring a bottle of sunscreen to avoid sunburn.
Bring an umbrella and bury the bottom handle in the sand to prevent it flying away.
Most hotels along the beach have umbrellas and beach chairs, sometimes limiting them to the hotel guests.
Sunglasses are useful if you don't want the sun in your eyes.
Carry a straw mat or beach chair if you don't wish to sit on the sand.
Towels are another option, but please have beach etiquette and shake any sand off from it away from people or wait until you get into the parking lot.
