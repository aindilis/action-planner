Invitations are very important when planning the party.

Plan the party out.
What games will be played?
A good relay race game is called "Fashion Run".
There are two teams, and each team gets shirts, pants, glasses, hats, jewels, and shoes in a suitcase.
The first person puts on everything and runs to the other side of the room and says, "Happy Birthday, [girl's name]!" and runs back and takes off everything.
When she reaches her team, the next girl goes and does the same.
The first team to finish is the winner.
Another game is "Fashion Hunt".
Divide the guests into teams.
Give each team a stack of fashion magazines and a list of fashion items to find in the magazines (Gucci bag, yellow flip flops, etc.).
The first team to find all the items on the list is the winning team.
Serve fashion-themed food and snacks ! At a bake store, you can find cookie cutters shaped like shoes, purses, bows, etc. Use them to make fashion-shaped pizza, sandwiches and/or cookies.
Remember that little girls can be picky or may have food allergies, so it's important that you have several options.
At most kid birthday parties, you'll find juice boxes, mozzarella sticks, veggie/fruit/cheese platters, and some grown-up foods for the adults.
Make or buy a fashion-themed cake.
If you choose to make your own, you could use a shoe-shaped cake pan or plastic Barbie high heels to decorate.
Be creative!
Add jewels, pink crystal sprinkles, etc.
Crafts : Buy elastic strings and beads and let the girls make these own necklaces, bracelets and so on..
you could also buy from a dollar store lipstick eyeshadow or any thing girl then let the girls make there own party bags
At the end of the party take their bags and put the goodies inside, they will love it  !
