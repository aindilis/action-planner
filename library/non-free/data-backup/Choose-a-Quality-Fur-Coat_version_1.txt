paperFreezerPanSpoonConsider why you want a fur coat.
Is it for fashion reasons, or do you want a high-quality, durable coat?
This reason alone can already give an idea of what you are looking for.
Select the fur.
Once you know why you want the coat, you can figure out what type of fur would work best.
Rabbit, fox, sable, and chinchilla are the furs typically used for fashion, while furs like wolf and coyote are more often used when a more durable fur is needed, like for hiking in cold climates.
Mink tends to work well in either direction because it naturally has a nice striped pattern but at the same time is semi waterproof.
Decide what style of coat is most practical.
While a long, robe-like coat may work for formal occasions, it is not practical for purposes like mountain climbing, which may call for a tighter fitting jacket.
