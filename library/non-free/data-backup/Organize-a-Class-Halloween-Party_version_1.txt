labelsSend a newsletter to the parents.
Parents always like to know what's going on at school, and some children will not tell their parents about the party.
Send a newsletter home explaining that on the 31st of October, you'd like to have a Halloween party.
Ask the parents to send the child to school in an appropriate costume on that day.
Also, ask them to send the child to school with a small treat to share with the class, like chips, brownies, cupcakes, fruit, vegetables or pop.
Have sign-up list for snacks.
Request the children write down what they plan on bringing.
If there is a scuffle over who brings which treat, pick a number from one to ten.
It's the only fair way.
The reason for the sign-up list is so that there is a good variation of treats.
This way, instead of having five bags of Doritos and a bottle of pop, you'll get more variety.
Plan out activities for a younger group.
For example, if your class is a younger group, consider a Pin the Tail on the Black Cat, Musical Broomsticks (same as Musical Chairs, but with broomsticks), Find the Witch's Broomstick (simply hide an old broomstick somewhere in the room), Halloween Charades (characters can include a witch, a ghost, a cat, etc), and Find the Big Black Cat (put black paw prints around the school, and have your class follow them around, into rooms such as the gym, library, computer room, and perhaps a friendly teacher's room.
Have them lead back to the classroom, where a snack for each child will be waiting).
