on.Get a backpack or tote bag.
You don't want anything too bulky, and it should be comfortable enough to carry around for a little bit, whilst still fitting in everything you need.
Make sure you have everything you need for the day.
At most summer camps you will need a towel, sunscreen, a bathing suit or change of clothes, sandals and sneakers or sturdy shoes, sunglasses and a hat, and a water bottle.
Put everything neatly into the backpack so that it won't be too hard to take things out.
