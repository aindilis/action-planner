glassesEncourage teenagers to get up and dressed in the morning regardless if they have plans or not.
This helps stimulate their brains and reduces the chance of them being slouching around all day in their pajamas.
Ask about the whereabouts of their closest friends . This shows the teen you are interested in their social life.
Suggest they phone them and make plans.
If there is nothing to do in your area allow the teen to invite friends over.
(see tips for more.)
Take time to speak and interact with your teenager when in the house.
Ask them frequent questions such as " Are you enjoying the holidays?" to ensure they are getting the most out of their time off school and if not ask them why.
