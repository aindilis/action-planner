goals.Choose your location.
Research it online and discuss it with your fellow travelers.
Make a list.
A helpful tip for researching online is to make use of Travel 2.0 websites.
Websites are a great place to browse travel photos, journals and videos posted by real people sharing their experiences.
For example, before going on a trip to Japan, do a quick search -- you'll get all kinds of stories and advice from people who recently visited Japan.
Each trip offers you connected experiences from real people so that you can get a better picture of the place you want to go.
Keep in mind weather and climatic conditions, merits and demerits of the place, types of recreation (beaches, culture, shopping), and facilities (transport, eating out, etc).
Plan around your location.
What clothes are suitable?
Are any medications needed?
Do you need to take foodstuffs?
What about currency?
Make a loose schedule.
Planning too far ahead may backfire, because vacations hardly ever go as planned.
Plan for spontaneity, but keep hints from travel guides in mind.
Mark places to visit and things to do.
How many days do you have?
You should keep the overall schedule in mind - you do not want to end up too tired (or alternatively, bored).
Make a list.
Write down the places you want to visit, including restaurants, museums, malls, and other places of interest.
This will help give you ideas and prevent being completely lost when you arrive and do not know what to do.
Make a budget.
If you plan ahead, you can save on ticket prices.
Travel light.
Leave space for shopping.
Moreover, traveling with lots of luggage restricts your movement and causes discomfort.
Only pack the necessities.
Notify a friend or family about your leaving.
If possible, leave them a contact number or address.
If traveling internationally, make sure your documents are in order.
Keep your passport, travel documents, visas, and similar items in a safe pouch.
Buy film, or keep digital camera batteries on hand.
