Start with your first category and look for stuff in that category.For example, if your first category is school supplies, the items would be pens, paper, pencils, a stapler etc.
Then move on to your next category and so on.
But stop at other if you have one.
Finally, you will have stuff that you need at your desk, but ask yourself do you really need that bouncy ball or flashlight ?
The stuff you know you need and you use often put in the other bag or box if you have one.
If it is broken throw it away.
If it is useless throw it away.
If it usable and you don't want it, give it away.
