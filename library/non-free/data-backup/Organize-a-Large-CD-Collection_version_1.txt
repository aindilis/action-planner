safely.Go through your CDs and decide which ones you actually care about.
Sell or give away any CDs you aren't attached to, and if there are any that you like, but don't really care about, make copies and keep them alphabetized in a CD wallet.
This is an ideal rack.
See tip #3 for details.
Purchase a good storage item.
After you have decided which CDs to keep, invest in (or build) a large CD case /rack.
Choose your organization method.
If you have visited a music store, you'll know that CDs are often sorted by artist and/or genre.
These are both good ways to organize CDs and you may consider doing both.
Set aside an entire weekend to do the actual organizing.
If someone asks you what you're doing that weekend, you will sound pathetic.
But it is a small price to pay to be able to easily listen to your music.
Alphabetize a pile for each letter of the alphabet.
Decide if bands that start with numbers come first or under the first letter of their number.
After you have organized these sub-piles, just put them on your CD rack.
