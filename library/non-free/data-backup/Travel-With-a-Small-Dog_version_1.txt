up.First find a hotel that allows dogs.
Some places have a weight limit, and you usually have to pay a fee.
If you are driving its a good idea to have your dogs bed available to them during the entire car trip.
If you are flying have your crate comfy.
Put a blanket and something that smells like home such as a favorite toy, or a towel.
Also have a 'doggie bag,' for your pet.
Here is what you should fill it with, an extra leash, 1-2 toys or balls, a blanket, something that smells like home (a towel works well), treats, 2 dishes (for water and food), and obviously food.
Once you get to your hotel set up a little corner with all your dogs stuff.
Have their bed and toys there as well.
Put them in their bed and give them a treat and say ' your dogs name here bed!'
This will make them understand this is their space.
Ask the hotel where it is okay to let your dog go to the bathroom.
Have a bathroom schedule that you follow about one week before the trip.
Use this schedule during the trip so your dog doesn't need to learn it during the trip.
