EATING!Start cooking . Many people eat fast food or junk food because they're always on the go and have no time to cook for themselves (it's called fast food for a reason, right?).
Even if you don't have much time, try learning a few quick&easy recipes.
If you're so into junk food, perhaps trying to make your own burgers and French fries is a good idea.
Generally, food you prepare at home is healthier than what you can find at a fast food restaurant.
Expand your culinary horizons.
Most people find junk food very tasty, but there are also lots of meals that are healthy and delicious at the same time.
If you don't want to cook, you can still try new dishes by going to different restaurants.
Know what junk food can get you into.
Unhealthy eating leads to obesity, and obesity leads to many health problems, for example cardiovascular issues.
Not to mention the aesthetic issues.
Eating a lot of junk food is often associated with other lifestyle problems, like lack of physical activity, TV or Internet addiction, bulimia, sometimes even depression.
Know if you have any of these problems, and treat them accordingly.
Stop buying junk food.
You can't eat it as long as you don't have it, right?
Just don't put that pack of chips into your shopping basket next time you go to the supermarket.
Buy healthy things instead- fruits for example.
