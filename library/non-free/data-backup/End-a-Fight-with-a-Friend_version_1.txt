worse.Let the argument simmer for a while, by leaving it alone, and avoiding communication.
If you talk right after the fight, many things are said out of anger.
However, do not wait too long as allowing bad feelings to brew for too long creates a situation that becomes more difficult to make up.
So after the fight calms down, make sure you talk to the person before its too late.
After you do that, sit down and say you're sorry if you are the one who caused the fight.
Even if it was the other persons' fault, just take the blame so you will make up sooner than later.
Take time to reconsider if this person is really a friend if you're constantly in fights and always making up first.
Reflect on what you may have done.
Read past emails, chats ect.
This will help you understand their point of view.
Give in and apologize.
The other person probably wants to do it too, but it shows that you're a courageous and dedicated friend.
Remeber to always say you're sorry first then to make up.
Also try not to be to hard on yourself!!
