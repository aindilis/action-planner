featurePrepare the concrete surface that you plan to paint.
Clear the entire surface of furniture, flowerpots and toys.
Sweep and clean the patio thoroughly to remove any dirt and dust.
Scrub the patio to remove oil spills or any type of sticky grime from the concrete surface.
Rent a pressure sprayer to remove stubborn grime.
Work with a paint removing solvent and/or scrapers to remove any old paint.
This step can be time consuming, but it's necessary for a beautiful painted concrete patio.
Otherwise, you'll end up with visible bumps and an uneven texture on the painted concrete patio.
Give the patio cleaning process thorough attention.
Even if the patio doesn't appear to be dirty, clean it anyway.
Specs of dust can be hard to see, but they can mess up a new paint job.
The patio cleaning will define the quality of your finished painted concrete patio.
Select the concrete paint you want to use.
The color should compliment your patio area.
Ask paint professionals in your area for recommendations of concrete paints that will withstand the weather extremes for your outdoor patio area.
Use painters or masking tape to protect the patio edges, doorframes or areas you do not want to have paint on.
Begin painting.
Use a long-handled brush or a brush-length extender to make the process of painting easier.
Start in a corner using even brush strokes, while working your way outward.
Cover the entire patio area in a light coat of concrete paint.
Allow this first coat to dry completely.
This should taketo 4 hours or the length of time recommended by the concrete paint manufacturer.
Apply subsequent coats of paint until you achieve the desired look.
Allow paint to dry between each coat, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Give your newly painted concrete patio time to dry, set or cure before using it.
In most cases, this can take several days, depending on your climate.
