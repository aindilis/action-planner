heart.Book your son's Bar Mitzvah ceremony at your Synagogue.
Decide whether you will be having the Bar Mitzvah party at home, or somewhere else.
If decided upon having it somewhere else, reserve a place for Bar Mitzvah.
Make a list of the guests which you would like to invite to your son's Bar Mitzvah.
This will include relatives (outside of immediate family), friends from school, sports, etc. Does your son have a girlfriend?
Then add her to the list, as he will love to have her there.
Hire a D.J., who will play a wide variety of music, including your son's favourite type of music as well as traditional Jewish music.
Does your son have a favourite charity which he is interested in ? Ask for donations for this charity, since it will help encourage him to be generous in later years.
Perhaps instead of a D.J., you may like to have a karaoke at your son's Bar Mitzvah.
Plan what type of food you would like to have served at your son's Bar Mitzvah (while it will all be kosher, you may decide that you would like a pasta bar, Chinese food, Israeli, vegetarian, etc).
You may decide to go with a theme for the party (eg : Hawaiian, Mexican, 50s style dress, etc).
You may decide to have door-prizes.
Make a list of things your son hopes to receive as Bar Mitzvah presents.
