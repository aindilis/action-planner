At the time of this writing, this would be version 10 (10.2.1 for Mac version).
This is available from Apple's website, or through the link at bottom.
Attach your iPod to your computer by whatever means it uses (dock, USB, Firewire, etc)
Open iTunes.
Click the button in the sidebar that says "YOUR_IPOD'S_NAME"
Click the tab at top that says "Summary."
Click the button that says "Restore."
Choose "Use Newest Version" when you are prompted for restore options - this will restore your iPod to the newest iPod software available.
