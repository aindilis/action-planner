objects.Select a frame for your jewelry display.
A reclaimed wooden window frame from an architectural salvage shop will work if you don't mind refinishing or painting it.
Another option is a ready made picture frame.
Measure the opening of the frame and cut chicken wire 1/2" larger than the opening.
Use a staple gun to attach the chicken wire to the back.
If desired, paint or finish the picture frame to match your decor.
Screw a chain to the back for hanging.
Put small 's' hooks in the chicken wire to hang necklaces and bracelets.
Dangling (hook) earrings can be hung directly onto the chicken wire.
