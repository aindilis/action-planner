you.Ensure your dog is well socialised and friendly with other people : men, women and children, people with hats, umbrellas, loud voices, loud laughing, excited squealing etc.
Train your dog to the level of basic obedience : come, sit, stay, down (or drop).
Familiarise your dog with stairs, elevators, ramps, walkways, automatic doors and tight spaces.
Ensure your dog is comfortable around wheelchairs, walking frames, walking sticks, crutches, beds and chairs.
They should also be able to stay still and calm when these objects are moved around them.
Contact a Pets as Therapy group for detailed information on the training required.
Contact local nursing home facilities and hospitals to gauge their level of interest.
Keep visits to an hour's duration to avoid tiring the dog.
Insist on being accompanied by a staff member at all times.
This is a safety issue.
Should a facility refuse to allow this, do not visit there.
Arrange for an inspection of the facility without your pet present.
Ask to be shown the areas you would visit and take note of anything that could create a problem with a visiting animal such as slippery floors etc.
Book visits ahead and always confirm visits a few days ahead.
