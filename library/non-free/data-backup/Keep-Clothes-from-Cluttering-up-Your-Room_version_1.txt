toGo through all your clothes + gradually throw out all your clothes that are out of fashion, too small, etc. This clears space and means there are fewer things to throw about!
Yes, it s a hard and pretty boring task but most things are in life!
Buy yourself some form of a washing basket.
You know those things you put dirty clothes in?
Don t leave your dirty clothes wherever they land!
Not all baskets are bland and simple; now-a-days you can buy them in different colours shapes and designs.
If you do happen to have a bland one you can always jazz it up a little by attaching stickers to it, use your imagination!
Clear out shelves in your cupboard or drawers in the chest of drawers that s currently filled with junk because you need places to store all those clothes.
Also assign a shelf to hold all your t-shirts, one to hold only jeans and so on, even label them if it helps!
Try to fling them in the same pile, and then when you wake up the next morning with lots of energy put the dirty ones in the washing basket and the clean ones away.
Know that when your washing comes back to you nice and dry and perhaps folded, try to keep it that way ! Either put it in your cupboard/chest of drawers right away or put the pile somewhere safe where it won t get knocked down.
