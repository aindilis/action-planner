Before milk...
... and after!
The mixture at this point will be a little dry.
Add the milk a little at a time until the dough starts to form.
Form the dough into egg shapes using your hands.
You can make lots of little ones or one big one.
Place the shaped pieces on waxed paper and place into the freezer for about an hour and a half for the eggs to firm up.
When you are ready to decorate the cakes , place the white chocolate squares in a bowl.
Heat a pan of water and place the bowl with chocolate inside the pan (a double boiler or a bain marie can be used also).
For the Yoshi style egg, dip the egg shapes into the white chocolate and roll around with a spoon, and scoop out onto a piece of waxed paper.
If the chocolate cools too quickly, dab a bit of frosting on the cakes to hold the sweets in place.
