you.Choose the right career for yourself.
If you're someone who despises meeting deadlines, it doesn't make a lot of sense getting a job that requires you to meet these regularly, especially within tight timeframes.
Get this part right and you're halfway there.
Be organized.
The person who is organized knows where things are physically and mentally.
Organization allows you to maintain a steady pace on the project you're working on.
It permits you to find tools of the trade quickly, and it ensures that you're able to keep the pace going when the deadline comes closer.
Good organization means not leaving everything until the last minute but knowing that every moment counts from the start.
Use calendar tools.
Mark set periods at which you expect to complete stages of whatever it is you're working on and work toward each of these mini deadlines.
Have reminders sent to you.
Use sticky notes on your mirror if that helps too!
Meet each mini deadline, and you will feel more comfortable about meeting the large deadline.
Keep things simple and remove distractions.
If you know TV makes you lose track of time, stop watching it or stopwatch it.
Remove things that cause you to get sidetracked from your goal.
Get help when it's clear you need it.
If you need others to help, to give ideas, to solve problems with you, don't hesitate to draw them in.
There are many cases wherein a deadline was missed because the person was too scared to reach out for help.
