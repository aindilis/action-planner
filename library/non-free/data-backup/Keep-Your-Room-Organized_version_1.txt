is!Step back and evaluate your space.
Do you really have room for that comfy corner ? Or, do you need to move your desk there instead?
Put away your clothes.
Hang your clothes in a closet or a wardrobe, don't just throw them on your bed!
Not only will it make you think, somewhere in your brain, that the bed is not for sleeping, making you sleep less, but it makes your room look so much messier than it is! It makes an easy or medium job look simple.
Well, it makes it look like there is nothing simple about it!
Organize your books.
Figure out how you want to organize your books.
If you read on a regular basis, and even if you don't, you need to keep it organized.
You may organize by priority, category, then finally in alphabetical order.
Organize your personal hygiene items.
Look at your personal hygiene items, such as makeup.
You need to throw away the crumbly, broken, and unused stuff, like that deodorant that smells like cat litter.
Separate and put away the makeup you only use for special occasions from your everyday items.
Organize your entertainment systems.
When you're done playing video games, roll the wires up and put them away.
Keep food out ! Unless you are doing a science experiment on how much bacteria grows and vermin appear when you leave food or dirty dishes in your room, or want your room to become a compost, please eat in the kitchen!
You also do not want to have a cluttered desk or table so clean as regulary as possible.
