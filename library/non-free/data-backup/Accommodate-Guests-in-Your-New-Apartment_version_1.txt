(Optional)Friends!Plan your space Furnish your apartment with pieces that serve multiple purposes.
Stools and pillows look great and can be used for extra seating.
Tables that fold or expand can temporarily double your serving space.
Clear the Clutter Put away any knickknacks, counter clutter, and small decorative furniture.
Your valuables will not only be safe, but you will have more surface space and the room will seem bigger and more inviting.
Delegate Once your children have grown out of calling peanut butter and pickles a dinner, ask them to help with the preparations ! If each adult prepares an appetizer, desert or entr e, your preparation time will be cut significantly, your kitchen will stay cleaner and everyone will be able to contribute to the day.
Make after-party arrangements Are people coming from out of town ? Will alcohol be served?
Is transportation available?
If any of your guests will need overnight accommodation, make sure arrangements are made before the big day.
A smaller home means less space for unexpected overnight guests.
Don't forget the children If children are coming, make sure there is a safe space away from the excitement of the party available.
In an apartment, a bedroom or office can be used for this purpose.
Young children may become overwhelmed or tired before the day is through and having a 'children's only' area will make sure that they enjoy the day as much as the adults.
Eat simply Unless you are planning a formal dinner, serve simple food that won't stain clothes.
If everyone can't fit around a single table, skip the dinner time ordeal and allow your guests to mingle and graze the food.
