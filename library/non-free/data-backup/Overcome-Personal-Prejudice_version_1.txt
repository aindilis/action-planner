beerThink about the phrases you use regularly or reasonably often.
Have you ever said something like "She's sooo blond!" or "That's just gay"?
Both imply negative assumptions!
How about "Boys will be boys," which implies that boys can't behave better, should be expected to be crass, cruel, and careless, etc.
Make a list of all the phrases you hear that imply negative things about a category of people, whether they are based on gender, appearance, religion, politics, etc.
Now replace the general category with your own name.
Instead of "She's so blond," see how it feels to have that judgement applied to yourself - "I'm so blond."
Now think about people you know (or know of) who have that characteristic and are not "stereotypical" of the trait.
Martha Stewart is blond.
She certainly isn't stupid.
Maybe your cousin Joe is blond and graduated top of his class at a prominent law school.
Note all the exceptions to the genralisation you can think of.
Do this with each generalisation.
Replace the main character with yourself, and see how the assumption feels.
Find positive examples of each maligned group.
