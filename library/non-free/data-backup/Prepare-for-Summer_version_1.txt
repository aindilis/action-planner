spark.Buy the things you'll need like sun screen or season passes to a theme park.
Buy cool clothes and accessories that are IN this season so you will look totally stylish.
If you're on a tight budget then stay close to home.
Keep it simple.
You will feel very lazy during the summer, so don't wear a lot of makeup, but still, take care of yourself.
Wear some waterproof mascara, full coverage foundation(be sure to take it off at night),add a small amount of blush to give you a shimmering glow, and don't forget lip gloss (you'll want your lip gloss that blends with your lips).
Sign yearbooks . All you need to say is, "I hope you have a good summer and I hope to see you next year!"
Then sign your first and last name.
If you don't want to say much to a person you don't like all you need to do is just sign your first name.
Take pictures ! Buy a camera.
It's good to make a photo album so you can visit memories whenever you want.
Get into some classes for the summer.
Don't waste this season watching TV every day.
Get into crafts classes, swimming classes or even dancing classes.
Anything that can keep you from spending hours watching TV.
Start working on your body.
At a local gym you can play badminton, volleyball, Frisbee, ping pong etc. Those are some favorites.
If you aren't active much, a walk in the park will do you good.
Maybe start eating healthier so you will feel your best when you wear that bikini.
Rockclimbing or sportclimbing is a great thing to do during the summer but the rockclimbing joints are hard to find so you're lucky if your town offers one!
Get a tan . Be careful, you don't want to end up looking like a carrot.
Just buy a nice spray tan from a local drugstore, but never apply it with your hands.
Rent a beach house.
There's nothing better than relaxing at the beach watching the ocean.
Work on your confidence . There's nothing better than someone walking with his/her head straight up feeling her best.
