this.What you'll need
Raid the office supply room . You will need 8 medium size binder clips (1 and a quarter inches wide) and 4 rubber bands.
That's it.
Arranging the binder clips
Arrange the clips . Take the 8 clips and pull the metal handles back, so they rest on the black metal clip (as shown).
Now on their sides, arrange them into a circle.
The shape will look more like a flower, and may not be a 'perfect' circle , but get as close to it as you can.
Bring in the rubber bands!
Enforce the shape with rubber bands.
With your flower-looking shape laid-out and ready, take two rubber bands and stretch them out between four fingers, as shown, larger than the circumference of the clips.
This will allow you to drop them down over the clips in one smooth motion, so it contacts all the clips at once - otherwise your shape will not stay intact.
After applying the first pair of rubber bands, carefully flip it and apply a second pair.
If you need to reshape the "flower", poke a finger or a sharpie in the center of the clips.
Adding writing implements
Add pens and pencils.
You can keep the color the same for a sleek minimalist look or use different colors to create something more eye-catching.
Adding photos
Add photos.
Time for the creative fun!
Placing them in between the handles of silvery metal, add photos, postcards, notes -- whatever you'd like.
