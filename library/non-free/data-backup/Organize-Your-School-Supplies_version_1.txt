Keep all papers flat, unbent, and unripped.This way, you don't have paper sticking out of the top of your binder, and it also helps the papers that you need to keep stay fresh.
Try not to use the pockets on the side of your binders to store loose papers.
This is being lazy and not putting them in the place in your binder where it belongs (such as somewhere in one of the dividers).
Usually if you put just a few loose papers in the pouch, it starts building up and getting out of hand.
Have folders.
Instead of carrying all of your binders home from school, create a homework folder to take home everyday.
The less you carry around your binders to get ripped and worn, the longer they will last.
Keep everything hole punched.
(Some pencil cases or rulers have three hole punches attached to them.)
This will help things stay out of the "loose papers pocket" on the inside of your binder.
Carry a pencil case.
This will help you be prepared for every class.
Always have paper.
This will also help you be prepared for class.
Have a place to keep papers at home.
You could use folders or small containers.
This way you can clean out your locker or backpack and keep important papers (that you don't need for class)at home.
You can pull them out when ever you need to study for a test and will keep you from having TOO MUCH stuff at school.
