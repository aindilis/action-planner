information.Make sure you make all the necessary arrangements to have a concert.
If you are a child or teen, getting your parents permission is ALWAYS the FIRST thing to be done.
Then, arrange with your band what date would be available for everyone.
Decide what songs your band will be playing and rehearse them.
Make sure to have a dress rehearsal on stage before the concert.
Choose the part of your house that you wish to have the concert at.
It would be best to choose somewhere with a flat surface.
If you don't have a big enough yard, you could always have your band set up in the garage and the audience be outside or have it inside your house if you have enough space.
Advertise.
Once everything is planned out, make flyers to advertise your band's event.
You could stick them up around your neighborhood or at school (if allowed) and hand them out to your friends, neighbors and family.
If you want, charge a fee.
You may be having this event to make money in which case you should create a reasonable fee to enter.
Decorate.
Clear the place of all litter and garbage.
Pick decorations that fit with your kind of music.
Balloons, banners, streamers and other party decorations should be considered.
Set up.
Set up the decorations and get ready a few hours before so that you can have one final rehearsal.
