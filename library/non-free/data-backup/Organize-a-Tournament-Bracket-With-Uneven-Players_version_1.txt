costs.Understand Byes
Byes are the empty slots in a bracket
A player matched against a Bye wins automatically
Each Bye is treated as a player.
The only difference is that it always loses.
Randomly placing the Byes doesn't work.
Here Jenny wonst place, but she only won one game.
A Bye is a huge advantage.
Above all your goal is to distribute them as equally as possible.
No player should get two byes unless every player has one.
Number your slots
Start with two slots--a single matchup: [1 2]
To expand them toslots, insert two new numbers inside each pair: [1 X] [X 2]
Make each new pair sum to (number of slots +): [1 4] [3 2] (In this case each pair sums to (4+1)=5)
Expand again forslots.
Make each pair sum to (8+1)= 9 : [1 8 ] [ 5 4] [3 6 ] [ 7 2]
Aplayer chart should be numbered like this one.
Continue until you have enough numbers.
Place them in your bracket in order
Use the lowest numbered slots for players; the rest for byes.
If you have a ranking, or seed of each player/team, place the best at #, the second best at #2 and so on.
This will keep the stronger teams apart until later rounds.
If you are running a casual pool tournament, you could just give each player the next available number.
This means the sooner they sign up, the better chance of getting a Bye.
A third method is to draw numbers.
With this method you must wait until you know how many players you will have.
Late arrivals are no problem; assign them the next available number.
In all cases, the Byes must get the highest numbers.
This spreads them out evenly ensuring that no player gets too many.
