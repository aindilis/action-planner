Week.Choose a date to hold your sale.
Make up some fliers about six weeks ahead of your sale date to let your neighbors know about your sale and ask them to join in.
Be sure to put your phone number and email address on your fliers.
Find and prepare the the items you wish to sell . Go through a closet or a drawer anytime you get the chance, and as you pull out things for your sale, go right ahead and mark them with prices, using a marker and some tape.
Put the items in a bag or the box, and tuck them away in the basement or the garage.
Send out another flier reminding your neighbors that the time has come.
Do this about a week to 10 days before the sale.
Try and paint the signs . Advertising is important here.
People won't come to a garage sale with a lopsided piece of cardboard as a sign.
Get a good piece of hardboard , and paint on your message in white.
Advertise in your local paper or an online classified site.
Include general street intersections, where you have signs, in your listing that will make it really simple.
It is easier to say go to 9th and 10th rather than 1000 9th st, because now they have to look that up.
Ask a participating neighbor to make some signs and put them out on busy street corners the night before the sale.
Arrange everything in your garage the night before.
If you need to set up on a driveway or yard, have everything near the door so you can run it all out and set it up quickly in the morning.
