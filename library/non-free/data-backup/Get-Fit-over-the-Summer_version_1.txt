family.Create a Plan.
Do not go into the summer just procrastinating on your goal.
Sit down for at least 10 minutes and write or type out a routine of reference of which to go by when you get home from your last day of school.
Include a healthier diet plan, exercise plan, and some specific goals in your plan.
Follow Through.
Make sure you want to follow your plan.
It sucks for the first few days, but it gets to be something you look forward to every day once your body gets used to the changes you have made.
Work It.
Once your plan is all set, begin on your exercises.
Incorporate body-weight exercises for the first few weeks.
(e.g. Pushups, Pullups, Chinups, Sit-Ups, Lunges and Squats).
These will condition your body to be able to perform better with weights.
Learn.
You have to accept that if you want to be thin, or the right weight you need to learn to eat healthy.
Find the right plan for you.
See Tips below for some weight loss techniques
Start Lifting.
Once your body is starting to change from exercising, you can start lifting actual weights.
These include but are not limited to dumbbells, barbells, or machines.
( Avoid machines as much as possible ).
Freeweights allow your body to move more naturally while lifting, which prevents injury.
