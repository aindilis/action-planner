visitingClick on the adopt a soldier here [1] . Fill out your registration form, being sure to include your complete email address correctly so you can be directly connected with a soldier.
After you register, the system puts you into a validating group and you will be sent an email with instructions on how to validate.
Once validated, you have access to the forum and other features on the site.
All you do next is WAIT for the AAUSS volunteers to send your soldier information via your email.
This is the perfect time to visit the forum, and 'how to send' and 'what to send' areas of the site!
Prepare for a short waiting time.
There has been an average of a 3-5 day wait.
When there is a program on TV, an article in the paper, or a blurb on the radio about adopting a soldier, there is a huge influx of registrations in a small amount of time.
If you wait more than 10 days and you had no special requests and have not heard anything from the organization or on the forum, contact them to ensure that there is no problems with your registration.
Also, ensure that your email is set to accept those from Adopt a US Soldier.
Make a 'special' request.
Preferences, like gender or branch of service can be fulfilled.
However, it is VERY difficult to fill requests beyond that.
Anything further cannot be done because there is limited information available on the soldiers.
If you receive a soldier that after contacting them, they are not what you wanted and you would not like to support this soldier, contact the organization and they will assign you another soldier.
