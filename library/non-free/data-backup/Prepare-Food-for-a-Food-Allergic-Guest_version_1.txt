Keep your hands washed at all stages of food preparation.
Be sure to dry them carefully on a clean hand towel.
Talk to your food-allergic guest.
Ask them exactly which foods cause a problem and whether they can be near others eating the problem food or not at all.
Ask the guest to suggest suitable foods.
If the guest is staying with you, visit the store together to stock up on suitable foods.
Be aware that your guest may wish to bring their own food.
Don't be offended by this; remember that this is a health issue.
Try to facilitate their need to prepare and heat the food separately.
Keep everything in the kitchen clean.
It is important to avoid cross-contaminating the food from the cooking equipment.
Thoroughly clean chopping boards, grills, pans, dishes, etc. before reusing for a different food.
Prepare the allergic person 's food on a different bench or separate area of the kitchen from the other food.
If you keep the utensils separate as well, there will be less chances for making a mistake.
Take care that you don't use the same knife for the peanut butter (for example) to add a spread, etc. Cutlery can transfer allergens easily.
