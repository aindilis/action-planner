Decorate the locker to suit your interests ! Stick some pictures of your pets, if you have some, or perhaps of the family members you like, on your locker!
It'll make you feel unique and motivated every time you open it.
It usually also feels nice when there's something you adore on your locker, not just random magazine pictures you have no clue about!
This goes with your favorite scenery, band, painting, animals, etc. That's the good thing about having your OWN locker!
Take some ribbons and decorate the outside of your locker.
