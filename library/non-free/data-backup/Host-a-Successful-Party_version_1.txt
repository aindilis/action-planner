Greeting guests at the door with a smile will help them feel comfortable right away.

To encourage mingling, put out less chairs than there are people.
People can't mingle if they are sitting.
Remember to put enough tables or an end table near the chairs so that people can put their plates down.
During the party, be sure you get a chance to talk to everyone there.
You invite people to your house to talk to them, not to make them wait.
Always remember to add non-alcoholic drinks to your menu.
Not everyone will want alcohol, and the designated drivers are going to need something to drink.
