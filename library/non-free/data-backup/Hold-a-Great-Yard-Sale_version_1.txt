it.Gather all the old stuff together.
Check each item closely.
Are they in good shape?
If so, sell it.
If not, trash it or try to fix it.
Create flyers for the yard sale.
Post them all over your neighborhood.
Check that this is permitted though!
Consider also advertising in the paper, online (Craigslist) and at the local supermarket bulletin board.
Set prices for everything.
Make sure the price is reasonable.
If you don't have prices, however, people will take advantage of you.
Set up your yard sale.
Use tables, large boxes, or just lay everything on the driveway.
However you set up, make sure:
People are able to access items easily.
The valuables are near you.
Freebies are in clearly marked boxes at the front of the yard.
Heavy items are close to transport for removal.
All weather covers are at hand.
Have change.
Organize this in advance.
There will be someone with a large note, as there always is!
Wait for customers.
Be patient.
They might not come for a while.
Sometimes they come in groups, so have people to help you available.
