Starting from the door to the far wall, and from the floor up, get everything off the floor and perhaps shove it outside your room temporarily.
Once everything is outside, sort it into 4 piles; donate, trash, recycle, keep.
Any dirty clothes, linens, or the like MUST GO IN THE WASH !
Haul in the vacuum cleaner and vacuum the floor, your desk, the blinds, your bookcase, your mattress, and anything else you can possibly vacuum.
You may want to ask your parents (or whoever usually does the cleaning) what can be vacuumed and what cannot.
With a damp cloth or appropriate cleaning agent (I prefer Pledge Multi-Purpose) dust all surfaces possible, including, mirrors, electronics, wall moldings, walls, posters, desks, etc.
Put everything that you want to keep, back in your room.
Now you have an organized room, but how do you make it unique ? Keep reading:
Perhaps you could paint the walls an interesting colour, but keep in mind that as a teenager, you may not like the colour in a years time.
Put up art, posters, or prints prints that you like.
To order posters online, try www.allposters.com.
Get new bed linens.
Make posters with pictures of you and your friends, ticket stubs, notes you passed.
Make sure that you like your room.
