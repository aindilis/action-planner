in.Look at your schedule.
Where will school fit in?
What days and times are available for you to go to school?
When will you study?
Consider what courses you want to take.
It might seem out of order, but to know what school you want to go to, you need to first seriously consider what it is you want to study, since some schools offer courses that others do not.
Figure out how you are going to finance graduate level education, since some colleges and universities accept scholarships and offer student work while others do not, so financing options may be limited in those situations.
Decide on a graduate level school.
You can use Google to search out schools in your area or that offer the courses you are interested in.
If the school is far away, you need to decide if you are willing to drive and if it is feasible - if driving there is too far, then consider if you are you willing to move.
Some graduate schools offer online courses, but you need to carefully investigate if they are accredited courses for your area of study before you invest any money into the program.
Get your stuff together.
Know if the college requires a certified or uncertified copy of your undergraduate grades and get them there before the deadline.
Know what tests, if any, are required to be considered eligible for application and take them.
Know what scores you need on the required tests so you are prepared and have time to retake any tests if necessary.
Consider hiring a tutor for the tests if you are not good at taking standardized tests as most schools are looking for basically the same information.
Apply to several schools who offer courses you are interested in so you have a choice in which one to go to.
