downside.Stay calm.
Any angry person can cause a chemical reaction within you that could make the situation worse.
Assess the reason why the person is angry at you.
Try to put yourself in their shoes.
What if they would have done to you what you did to them?
Don't be afraid to admit you did injustice to them.
It's an act of courage, as long as it doesn't become a habit.
Accept the fact that this person is angry with you, regardless of if it's true or not, let them vent, stand back, don't get in their way.
Show them you actually listen to what they say.
This may already be part of the solution.
Normally people will calm down if they see you have a sincere interest in what they say.
Communication is the keyword.
Time heals.
Hurt feelings can make people unable to reason well.
Many people react when they are angry by avoiding the person they are angry with for a while.
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.
It gives time to reflect and in many cases we just then realize how much we care about the other.
In quicker situations, try to follow the previous steps and stretch out time as best you can without being obvious.
Break the loop.
Angry people can often repeat themselves when they aren't thinking rationally or think you don't get what they mean.
Find a way to stop the repetition by telling them you understand, repeating what they said in another way, or by simply changing the subject slightly.
