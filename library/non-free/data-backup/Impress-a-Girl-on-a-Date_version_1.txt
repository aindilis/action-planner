rejected.Take the initiative.
If you don't invite her on a date, she most likely won't invite you.
Be nice when inviting her; you could let her pick the place you go and you can pick her up at her place.
However, don't spend a large amount of time deciding what to do.
Be decisive.
Have a plan B as often as possible.
Be a real gentleman . Buy her live flowers, open the car door, restaurant doors, give her your jacket (though it might be cheesy girls love it) everything.
Just be yourself . All you have to do is relax and don't worry about what she may be thinking of you.
Have no fear about putting yourself out there; that will just make her enjoy your company.
You'll show her you are comfortable around her.
Have a good sense of humor ! Laugh at her jokes and smile.
Never tell sad experiences, don't turn the date into a sad thing.
Stay confident.
Set goals . The most important goal to set is making her feel comfortable with you.
Ask her about what she does, likes, what her favorite movies are, and tell her about yours.
Be a good listener , switch "uh-huhs" for nods and smiles, and don't show disinterest.
Make sure you smile when you meet her, so that she will know you are excited to see her.
Tell her she looks great .
Listen to her carefully .
Make sure you don't go too quickly on your date.
