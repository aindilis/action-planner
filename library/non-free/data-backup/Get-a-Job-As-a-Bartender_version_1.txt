assistance.Check the local drinking ages in your area (e.g. England is 18, United States is 21).
If you are under the legal age, it is highly unlikely you will get the job.
See if any bars in your area are hiring.
Also, check out their hours, to make sure hey fit your schedule.
Put together a resume . Make a list of past jobs you have had, experiences with working with bars (if any), and hobbies.
Hand out the resume to your future managers at the bar, or whoever will be checking over them.
