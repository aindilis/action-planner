Apple).Who are you packing for?
If it is a lover, consider hard.
If it is just you, you can try either.
Where are you going?
Hard packing should not be done in public since it can look like an erection if not done properly and should your packer come loose and "pop up" it can be quite embarrassing.
Try a rolled up sock and put it in some tight briefs.
You can add a safety pin so your packer does not come loose and roll down your leg.
If you are a boxers fella, safety pin the sock to the inside of your boxers.
Just make sure it is positioned right before you pin it.
Check the mirror so your bulge looks right.
This is another good method for guys who like boxers.
Get a jock strap and put a commercially made packer in it.
Simply put your boxers and pants on and your good to go!
Choose a dildo- The bigger it is the harder it is to do and the more uncomfortable.
Pick what suits your needs for what you will be doing and how long you will be wearing your packer.
Decide realistic or non-realistic, for FTMs you would usually go with realistic but this is up to you.
If you are playing with a partner, think about their needs and wants.
Method 1- Get a harness, and a dildo of your choice.
Put it on like normal and then loosen the straps carefully but not so that it falls off.
Put your undies of choice over your packer (loose boxers are better if your packer is large sometimes getting 1 size larger than you need makes it less of a squeeze) Move the tip of your packy so it is tucked under the waistband of your undies.
Then add pants.
