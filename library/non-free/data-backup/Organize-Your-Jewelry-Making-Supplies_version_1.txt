anything!Get a few baskets preferably with handles.
Get one for your beads (if you don't have a box for them) one for your wire, and one for your pliers.
Sort out your beads.
Especially when it comes to seed beads, this can be a daunting chore.
It might take a while, but it's better than sorting through the piles on your desk every time you want a bead.
Sort them into a basket, or better yet, into a bead organizer.
Cover your pliers so nobody gets cut.
You wouldn't want any children running into the sharp pliers strewn on your desk.
Cover them by wadding up a bit of paper around the nub and securing it with a rubber band.
