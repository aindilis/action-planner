If it's a set hang the shirt and pant on the same hanger.

Most accessories like belts/scarves will hang up on hangers with other clothing items.
Shoes can be put into sections of the wardrobe or on the floor of the wardrobe, or you could put them into a shoe holder if you have one.
If you have any blankets/bedding then you could also put them into sections of the wardrobe, or leave a basket/box on the wardrobe floor and store them in there.
