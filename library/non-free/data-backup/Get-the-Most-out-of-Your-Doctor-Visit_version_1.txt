supplementsKnow thyself.
Each individual is unique.
Bodies are different, symptoms are different, and reactions to medications (for better or for worse) are different for each patient.
No doctor will know your body better than you know yourself.
Your doctor will be looking for what has changed or is different, and they must rely on you for that information.
Plan ahead.
Many patients arrive without consciously identifying their goals for the visit.
Make a short list of specific concerns you would like to discuss.
Dress for success.
Your practitioner needs to see and often feel the parts of the body in question.
Time spent dressing and undressing is time you could be spending face to face with the doctor.
For example, if you have a cough and ask if you might have pneumonia, or if you have concerns about your heart , expect to have to take off your shirt (and bra, if appropriate) to have them listen to all parts of your lungs and heart.
Wear a shirt that buttons all the way down.
Know what your practitioner wants from you.
Primary care practitioner have an average of 10-15 minutes to spend per patient, from start to finish, including asking you all their questions, performing a physical examination, determining a diagnosis, and prescribing whatever treatments are necessary, then to write it all down in your permanent medical record.
You can count on a practitioner asking an alphabet of questions, with a common medical mnemonic being (O)-P-Q-R-S-T : Pain ( Where does it hurt?), Quality ( What does it feel like?
), Radiation ( Does it move anywhere?
), Scale ( How bad is it?
How much does it affect you?
), Timing ( When did it start?
How long does it last?
Does it come and go?
Is it gradual or sudden in onset?
What makes it better or worse?
), and Other ( Any other symptoms?
) The quicker you get those details out in the open, the quicker your practitioner can help you get to a diagnosis (and to a solution).
Be specific without being verbose .
