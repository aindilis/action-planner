house.First, you have to realize that you can't please everyone.
Sometimes you just have to walk away and know that you did the right thing for you.
Explain your reasons for saying "no" in the first place.
For example, it makes you uncomfortable, it goes against something you believe, or you feel it's wrong.
If you feel it's appropriate, apologize that you can't (or won't) comply with the request, but don't give in because you 'feel bad.'
If the person/group will not accept your lack of compliance, don't give in simply to please them.
If necessary, walk away.
If you feel that your reasons for saying "no" are reasonable, you do not have to feel guilty.
Just because they don't agree with your decision doesn't mean you are wrong.
