If there is an Open Day on offer celebrating IDD, you will be treated to additional information about the IDD.
Even where that is not the case, take the opportunity to tour your local parliament or legislature and to learn more about what happens there during working hours.
Find out what the democracy theme is for the year you're celebrating.
Each year carries a particular theme concerning democracy.
For example, in 2010, the theme is "political accountability: strengthening links between parliaments and citizens".
Activities are organized around the theme, and many parliaments pick up on these so that citizens can participate.
Explore the theme in detail.
The information will be provided for you online and in your local parliament, so it is definitely worth making the most of these resources.

Read the Universal Declaration on Democracy.
It can be found at: http://www.ipu.org/cnl-e/161-dem.htm.
Reflect on what democracy means to you.
Write down some ideas of what democracy means to you.
You might like to write an essay , a poem, or a short story even.
Perhaps seek to have it published online or in print.
Think about taking your understanding further by asking yourself (or your friends and family) some questions:
What elements are most important about democracy from your point of view?
Do your political or other beliefs impact your view of democracy?
In what ways?
Is this a good thing or not?
Do you think that other people have different views of what constitutes democracy from yours?
In what ways?
In what ways do you think political tolerance could be advanced in your country?
Do you think that your country's take on democracy is the same as how other countries view it?
Speak to your kids or to kids you know about democracy.
Find out what they understand democracy to mean and perhaps spend some time helping them to create pictures, stories, or even short videos to record their thoughts.
If you have their parents' permission, why not upload their video thoughts onto YouTube ? It could be a great way to open discussion and serve as a historical viewpoint in time to come, and it is always eye-opening for "grown-ups" to see how kids view democracy!
A great question for kids to answer is: "What would you do if you were Prime Minister/the President?".
Have kids write letters to their local member of parliament asking anything they'd like to know.
