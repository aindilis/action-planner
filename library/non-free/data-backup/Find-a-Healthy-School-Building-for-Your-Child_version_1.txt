If you see any of the above, or especially, if you find any issues that you feel directly point to mold or indoor dampness problems, you may wish to alert the school district (if it is minor) and select another school or healthy building for your child(ren) if you feel the problem is serious.
Parent options include another classroom or building, another school within the same district, a different district, a charter school, private school, or homeschooling.
Remember to inspect the buildings for the options, first - and do everything legally, within state law.
If your child is ill, seek medical advice from a physician familiar with mold-related illness (this goes beyond allergies).
Lists of physicians are available on www.schoolmoldhelp.org on the Resources - Medical page.
