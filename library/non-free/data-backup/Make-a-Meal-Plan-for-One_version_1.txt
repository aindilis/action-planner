(optional)Take a writing pad and a pen.
Think about your schedule :
What days of the week are you home late?
Chances are you are too tired to even think about cooking, let alone shopping for food!
What days are you home a little earlier, or maybe working from home?
Consider cooking extra on these days.
For example: have a rice dish on Tuesday and a fried rice dish on Thursday, made with the leftover rice.
Browse your recipe books.
Make a draft like this :
Monday: salad.
Tuesday: chicken curry with rice.
Wednesday: mashed potatoes, peas and a pork chop.
Thursday: fried rice with vegetables and fish.
Friday: soup and a sandwich.
Saturday: dinner date (yes, you can still eat out if you want!)
Sunday: treat yourself to a three course meal.
Google meal plan . Then you have two options:
You may subscribe to a site where you can browse through online recipes, put together a menu, and create a shopping list.
Or if you can't find the time to sit down and put a menu together, you may use a ready made menu.
These mostly come in the form of a newsletter, to which you must subscribe.
