event.Ask your parents why exactly they don't want you going to the party, and if there's anything you can do to make them feel more comfortable,you should do it !
For example, if they're afraid you'll stay up too late, ask your parents to talk to the host or the host's parents, and discuss bed time.
Let them know that your friends' parents said yes and that the sleepover is going to be supervised.
Behave and do what you are asked !
Quit the needy looks.
Parents know all the tricks and hate being manipulated.
Ask them for a sleepover at your place.
That way they can supervise and feel safer about your involvement.
If your parent's still don't want you to go, consider doing a half sleepover, and your parents will pick you up around 10,11,12 or whenever.
