cameraChoose your location wisely.
Beaches are usually breezy.
Try to pick a cove or area protected from direct winds for your ceremony.
Be mindful of the tides.
Decide how many guests will be attending.
Most beaches do not require a special permit for small informal weddings.
Check with local authorities to be sure.
Find a wedding officiate local to the beach of your choice to perform your wedding ceremony.
Often they specialize in beach weddings and can provide useful tips as well as very affordable package deals.
Wedding packages are becoming very popular and are ideal for busy couples.
Often they include everything you need from the bouquet to the photography to the filing of your marriage license.
Minimize your reception expenses by planning a sunset ceremony followed by a simple but elegant wine and cheese reception right on the beach.
Rent an outdoor canopy to protect your reception area from rain showers and uninvited seagulls.
For a tropical flare, decorate the canopy with tulle and twinkling mini-lights and silk flowers.
Use hurricane candles for lighting.
Remember your guest's comfort and safety.
Provide seating for the elderly as well as sunscreen and insect repellent just in case.
If some of your guests have mobility impairments recognize that it's nearly impossible to push a wheelchair in the sand, and it's very hard for people who have difficulty walking to negotiate sand as well.
Many beaches have walkways or platforms.
Use these accordingly.
