(optional)Determine just how much "birthday" your child can handle.
While it's great that you want to celebrate this milestone, your child probably won't get the significance of the day.
If your baby is particularly shy around other people, a low key family only event may be best.
Keep it small.
Invite just a few close friends.
Most children at this age will be overwhelmed by too many people.
A few people you know from a local baby group or class who your child has met before may be best.
Keep it short.
A few hours is more than sufficient.
Be mindful of your child's normal routine.
Scheduling a party during naptime invites disaster.
Remember if there will be older children, have something to entertain them.
If the only other children will be around one year old, just put a few toys and snacks out.
