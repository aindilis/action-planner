vodkaOpen the Program Microsoft Paint.
This will probably be on your Start Menu at the bottom left corner of your task bar.
Once you have opened the program look at the tool "box" at the left side of the window.
Look on the tool "box" there is a ellipse or an "oval" at the very bottom left of it.
Click that tool.
You can now draw ovals or other "circle like" shapes.
Draw with the tool, it is hard to draw a circle, but here is the magic part.
This is what makes the circle perfect.
Keep drawing the oval, do NOT let go of the button on your mouse.
This will just make the oval stay an oval.
Finish step 4, press the "Shift" button on your keyboard.
You should have one finger on "Shift"and one on the left mouse button.
The shift key.
Press "Shift" for a moment, your oval will automatically change to a circle !
Make that shape stay a circle, let go of the mouse button first, then let go of the "Shift" button.
