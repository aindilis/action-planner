won't.Try to recall at least a single word from your lost message, and preferably (yet not bounded to) know where it was placed in that message Sender s name, subject, body of the email etc. This is your keyword.
Locate the search box in your email account.
The search box may be titled as search , find or any title which implies of searching.
Type your key word into the search field and click the search button.
This is the most basic form of search.
Search Folders; Every email account is divided into folders : Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items and personal folders you may have created.
If you recall the lost message was already sent or is related any of these personal folders, specifically search the relevant folder by opening it and performing the search again.
Recall if your search word appeared only in the subject field or in the sender s name and if so, the Advanced Search options will allow you to search your keyword in specific parts of the email and by so to narrow down your search even more.
