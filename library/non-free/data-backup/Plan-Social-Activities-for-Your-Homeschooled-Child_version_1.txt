calendar.Look for established groups.
There are likely many different homeschool groups for a variety of activities and ages in your area.
They may meet once or twice a month - or even more often - for games, physical activities, music or drama clubs, field trips, or crafts.
Consider starting a group.
If you don't find any for the age range or activities that interest your child, start your own!
Would your children enjoy a reading club?
Chess?
Swimming?
Ice skating?
Gardening?
Singing in a choir?
Hiking?
Volunteer work?
The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.
Likely other families would also be interested but haven't taken the initiative to do it themselves.
Mayday activity
Plan an activity.
Plan something that is age appropriate for all in the group, such as mini golf, a trip to a museum, the movies, a get-together art class, basketball game, or simply pizza and kickball.
Find a location.
You can look to churches, community centers, parks, libraries, or even businesses for rooms to fit your group's needs.
Some may charge a fee, but others will be happy to let you use their facilities for a donation or service hours - or even at no charge!
Advertise your group or activity.
Contact other homeschool parents through local organizations.
Advertise on homeschool forums, newsletters, websites, or in the newspaper.
