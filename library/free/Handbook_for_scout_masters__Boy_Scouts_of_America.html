<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the early summer of 1911 we sent out our Boys&#39; Handbook, which was most kindly received. Boys in all parts of the country have found the information of great value. Its use, however, has disclosed the need of a supplemental book, the primary purpose of which should be to show Scout Masters how to use the material in the Boys&#39; Handbook. This need has been emphasized by the constant calls for information which have been coming to the office at National Headquarters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This book is in answer to these calls, and is sent to</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scout Masters with the sincere hope that it will help</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>them in maintaining interest in Scouting and in directing</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>th&#187; P&quot;*<span class="gstxt_sup">;</span>vities of their <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>along right lines. As</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>andbook, so in this book/we have tried to keep</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>himself is first; and we realize that</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>.. purpose in this <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Movement is not to exploit methods, nor to glorify a movement, nor to bring honor to Scout Masters, but to lead boys into useful lives. ..</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>An examination of this book will show how we have tried to accomplish our purpose. In order that the Scout Master may be intelligently informed concerning the Movement of which he is so important a part, the National organization is described; for the purpose of promoting effective local organization various suggestions are made; and to bring about uniformity, the Scout requirements set forth in the handbook are here elaborated so that they may be intelligently applied in the same manner in all places.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The principles and methods of the Scout Movement which we hold to be fundamental, are set forth by one to whom we owe much, John S. Alexander. He brought to our staff a keen mind and a large practical experience with boys, and we are glad to have this opportunity of expressing our appreciation of all the services he has rendered.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The forms of drill which we advocate have been prepared by Dr. Phillips and Dr. Elsom, and we wish to thank them for this voluntary service. We also wish to<span class='gtxt_body'>
thank Mr. Ormond E. Loomis for contributing the chapter on the Training of Patrol Leaders.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As a great many requests have come in from Scout Masters for advice as to how the meetings of their troops should be conducted, we have tried to meet them by our chapter on programs. These programs are intended to carry the troop progressively through the year, with indoor and outdoor activities. They are intended as suggestions and need not be followed in the order in which they are printed. We are deeply indebted to Mr. Irving E. Vining .for the time and effort which he has so freely contributed to make this part of our book available.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The task undertaken by the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America is not an easy one. The appeal is made to so many different kinds of boys, and so much of our effort must necessarily be experimental, that we crave the indulgence and cooperation of the men, Scout Masters and others, who are working with us in our endeavor to help the boys of America into more purposeful lives and better citizenship.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This edition of the book has been put in merely tentative form, for it is realized that many improvements might be made with the cooperation and helpful suggestions of Scout Masters and others actively engaged in the work. A limited number of these books are being printed in this form as a proof edition. Suggestions for alterations should be submitted promptly as it is desired to publish the final edition of the book before the camping season opens.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Organization;,; </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Origin of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America In the beginning of 1910 the idea of introducing the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Movement along lines similar to those of the English <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts, </span>which had been organized in 1907 and developed under the personal supervision of Lieutenant-&#39;General Sir Robert S. S.. Baden-Powell, was first proposed by Mr. W. D. Boyce of Chicago. Prior to this time a number-jof troops had been started in various parts of the country by men who had been impressed with the possibilities of t-r&gt;e scheme, through reading Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Baden-Powell&#39;s English handbook, &quot;Scouting for Boys.&quot; It is significant that Mr. Boyce&#39;s interest was occasioned because of an actual service rendered him in true Scout spirit by a London <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout, who because of his obligation to do a good turn daily and the rule against the acceptance of tips, greatly astonished and impressed Mr. Boyce. After conference with Sir Baden-Powell he secured the cooperation of friends in Washington, D. C, and proceeded to incorporate an organization of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America under the laws of the District of Columbia. This was effectively accomplished on February 8th, 1910. Headquarters for the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America were temporarily established at 124 East 28th Street, with the cooperation of representatives from a number of National organizations having headquarters in New York City.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Growth and Development.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Simultaneously with this effort, other organizations established National Headquarters for themselves. Happily, however, before the middle of July, 1910, all of these organizations with the exception of the American <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>merged with the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America. It was largely . through the efforts of Mr. Edgar M. Robinson that the different organizations were brought together. From the yerj</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>beginning he saw the possibilities of the Scout movement; his wide experience in boys&#39; work enabled him to give wise counsel in his endeavor to have the movement inaugurated under satisfactory conditions. The continuance of the American <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>in the field proved to be a source of embarrassment and greatly retarded the proper development of the movement in this country. Furthermore it was one of the important factors in causing a misunderstanding as to the true-aims and purposes of the movement because so much jerftphasis was placed by the American <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>upon military drill and training.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Through the influence of Adjt. General Verbeck, one of the National Scout Commissioners, the .National <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>disbanded early in the year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The National Council.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Early in the summer of 1910, it was deemed wise to secure for the movement a more representative and substantial backing. A conference was called of representatives from all existing organizations who might be interested in the development of this new organization. As a result of this meeting, at which thirty different existing organizations were represented, a committee on permanent Organization was appointed. This committee consisted of Ernest Thompson Seton, Chairman; Lee F. Hanmer, Secretary; George D. Pratt, Treasurer; Dr. Luther H. Gulick, Jacob A. Riis, Edgar M. Robinson, Colin H. Livingstone, Daniel Carter Beard, Adjutant-General William Verbeck and Col. Peter S. Bomus. As a result of the deliberations of this committee a working plan of the present organization was developed. This puts the administration of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America as an association in the hands of a National Council working through an Executive Board. This National Council is composed of representative and prominent men Who are selected for their positions by Local Councils throughout the country. The officers of this National Council are an Honorary President, two Honorary Vice-Presidents, a President, five Vice-Presidents and a Treasurer. There are also a National Scout Com&#9632;&quot;.ssioner and a Chief Scout who are honorary members &#39;1 standing committees. The president of the National cil is the active head of the organization, -rtunately about-this time, the infant organization was jred by a visit from Lieutenant-General Sir Robert<span class='gtxt_body'>
S. S. Baden-Powell. A dinner was arranged at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. The presence of the General and the publicity gained did much to focus the attention of the American people on the organization as the real organization of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout movement in this country.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Early Definite Accomplishments.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The demand for information from all parts of the country compelled the hasty production of a mass of literature giving an outline of the movement. Six bulletins were written and a revised edition of the English handbook for boys hastily prepared under the direction of Mr. Ernest Thompson Seton. The organization will ever be under obligation to Mr. Seton for his unremitting zeal and effort to produce this book and for his willingness to send it out in an uncompleted form in order to meet the insistent requests from the field.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>President Taft cordially consented to serve as Honorary President of the organization and Col. Theodore Roosevelt as Honorary Vice-President. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and Honorable Gifford Pinchot have become more closely identified with the movement by accepting membership on the chief scout staff, Colonel Roosevelt as Chief Scout Citizen and Mr. Pinchot as Chief Scout Woodsman. Other men of national reputation accepted membership on the National Council. An unusual group of efficient men consented to serve as members of the Executive Board. They not only gave freely of their money but generously gave much time at this important period in the development of the Movement.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Beginning January 1st, 1911, permanent headquarters were secured in the Fifth Avenue Building and an executive officer was employed. The first meeting of the National Council was held February 14th and 15th at Washington, D. C. The members assembled in the East Room of the White House and were addressed by President Taft. In connection with the meeting of the National Council, there was a conference of Scout Masters and Scout Commissioners.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Executive Board and Its Duties.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At each annual meeting the National Council elects an Executive Board of eighteen members, who have immediate charge of all the business of the organization. This Board,<span class='gtxt_body'>
having also legislative powers, makes its own rules, grants charters to Local Councils and credentials to Scout Commissioners and Scout Masters, copyrights badges, insignia, and other scout designs, arranges for their manufacture and distribution, selects designs for uniforms and scout equipment, and appoints an executive officer or Chief Scout Executive and such other officers and employees as may seem desirable.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>National Headquarters. These latter officers and employees have charge of the bulk of the national business of the organization and the routine work of the National Headquarters. They hold their positions at the pleasure of the Executive Board.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Chief Scout and His Staff.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Also upon the recommendation of the Executive Board, the National Council elects a Chief Scout, who is the honorary head of the organization. He appoints and is the active director of his own staff, made up of experts on the different phases of Scouting. This staff consists of the Chief Scout offices of Surgeon, Woodman, Stalker, Camp Master, Citizen, Director of Health, Director of Athletics and Director of Chivalry. These officers are appointed with the approval of the Executive Board, and are specifically charged with the development of the Scout programs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The National Scout Commissioner and Staff. The National Scout Commissioner is the head of a staff of official representatives of the various national organizations engaged in work with boys and also interested in the Scout program. The Commissioner and his staff adapt the activities to the needs of the groups represented, and work for the development of a high grade of leadership in boys&#39; work.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Community and the Local Council.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The promotion of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Movement is essentially a community enterprise. It is the community&#39;s opportunity to reach the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>with corrective influences for character building and good citizenship. To give the work proper direction, a governing committee, known as the Local Council, is needed in each community where Scouting is developed. Like the National Council these are com<span class='gtxt_body'>posed of men who are seeking for the boys of the community the very best things possible, and who are representative of all community interests. The Local Council, through Scouting, makes a valuable asset of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy</span>; it makes him cooperative in promoting the interest of the community and places a value on the minority years of his citizenship life; it is proof of the community&#39;s interest in the healthful, normal, mental and moral development of its boys.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Local Council and Its Officers. The Local Council receives its credentials or charter from the Executive Board of the National Council. It is composed of men representing all the various religious beliefs and interests of the community. Its boundaries are the political boundaries, or the borough or city lines of the municipal commonwealth. The Local Council through its officers,&#8212; its Court of Honor, Scout Commissioner, and various committees,&#8212; deals with all local Scouting matters. The Local Council has full authority within its own territory, and the National Organization depends upon it for recommendations in the issuing of badges and the appointment of Scout Commissioners and Scout Masters.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In order to understand thoroughly the duties and activities of the Local Council, it is needful to know how such a council is organized. A small group of six or seven men who believe in the scout idea and wish to start the movement in their community, should meet as a &quot; Committee of Organization,&quot; to take such. steps as are necessary to awaken an interest in the movement, and bring about the regular organization of a Local Council. Details of the plan to be pursued should be carefully considered, and the work divided among the men present. In proceeding to organize a Local Council, the following steps must be emphasized : &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Publicity Campaign.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>First &#8212; The necessity for a community-wide publicity campaign in an effort to inform the public generally about the Scout Movement is all-important. This may be accomplished through the medium of the local newspapers, by personal interviews and by public addresses. It should be clearly stated in articles and interviews that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span><span class='gtxt_body'>
Scout Movement is not antagonistic to any civic enterprise, but rather seeks to cooperate with all other good movements in the interest of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The Movement is wholly <i>non-sectarian </i>and plans to work with every sect and creed alike; it is <i>non-military, </i>and seeks to promote Peace Scouting and to develop educational character-building for good citizenship. It is wholly <i>non-partisan. </i>It cannot favor one interest against another and cannot countenance interference on any debatable questions, whether social, religious or political. It seeks to make the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>a more useful and appreciative son to his parents or to those to whom he owes his home comforts, a more diligent and obedient student in his school life, a more valuable aid to the community in promoting its material progress and protection, and a more efficient and better prepared young man in development for future citizenship and the pleasures and hardships of mature existence.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Cooperation with Other Interests.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By personal interviews, the committee on organization should seek to enlist the interest and cooperation of the principals and superintendents of public and private schools, representatives of churches, Sunday Schools, boys&#39; clubs (both denominational and undenominational) directors of playground associations, settlement houses, etc., and wherever possible, should endeavor to present the work by addresses in churches, schools, city clubs, or other organizations interested in the welfare of boys. Suggestive material for newspaper articles and lantern slides for illustrated lectures are always gladly furnished by National Headquarters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Membership of Representative Citizens.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Second &#8212; A selected list of representative citizens should be interviewed to obtain their consent to serve as members of the Local Council. All different creeds and sects should be <span class="gstxt_hlt">recognized </span>and all organizations dealing and working with <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>should be represented. The following is a list of some of the sources from which to select members of the Local Council: &#8212; civic authorities, boys&#39; clubs, charity associations, juvenile courts, public schools, Sunday Schools, church clubs, men&#39;s brotherhoods. Young Men&#39;s Hebrew Associations, Young Men&#39;s Catholic Associations, Young Men&#39;s Christian Associations, playground associa</p>

The number of men composing the Local Council should be determined by the size of the community. In a small town there should be at least ten members; larger communities may have from twenty-five to one hundred and fifty or more.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A Constitution. The committee on organization should further be prepared to submit to the newly organized Council a Constitution and By-Laws for their approval. It is deemed advisable that the following Constitution be adopted without alteration; the By-Laws, however, should be changed to meet local requirements. As suggestions the following Constitution and By-Laws are herewith submitted: &#8212;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Third &#8212; A public meeting should be arranged for at which the entire plan of organization should be submitted. This meeting should be for adults only. Sufficient notice should be given through the daily papers in order that everyone, who is at all interested in the scout work, may be able to attend and take part. Wherever necessary, special notices should be sent by mail. Greatest care should be exercised both in choosing the date and in the proper selection of a meeting place. The time of the meeting should not conflict with anything else of general interest to the public; and the meeting place ought to be centrally located in order to be available to all parts of the community alike, and should be wholly non-partisan in order not to give cause for prejudice to any class at this very important stage in the development of the work.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>Need for a Clear Conception of Purposes and <br/>                     Results. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In planning the program of this meeting, everything should be done with a view to giving the people of the community a clear conception of the aims of the Movement and its unusual possibilities for good among boys, so as to enlist their friendship and secure their sympathetic support. The chairman of the meeting should be one of the most representative men available in the community, but preferably not connected with the militia. Military men have greatly aided the Movement with their support, but it is essential because the character of the Movement is Peace Scouting, to have men as officers in the Council who are not connected with the military, so that the ideas of</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA12'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>peaceful scouting activity which we seek to promote, may find greater favor and more hearty support in the minds of the general public. Such men are usually very busy, but our greatest American citizens are none too busy to give such service to the boys of their communities, if they can be assured that by serving in this capacity, they will assist in forwarding this work among the boys. Arrangements should be made well in advance to secure an insp1ring speaker to give an address on the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Movement, which will lead up to the need of a Local Council. It is essential that the speaker be well versed in the principles and methods of the organization, so as to be able to answer questions on this subject. Such a man may be obtained from some adjacent city in which scout work has already been organized or the National Headquarters may be able to assist in securing a speaker. Whenever it is possible the National Headquarters will always be glad to lend such aid.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Purpose of the Meeting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>One of the local men, preferably a member of the &quot; Committee on Organization,&quot; should outline the purpose of the meeting and state fully what steps have been taken to start and develop a scout organization. The nominations of the Committee on Organization for the membership of the Council and its officers should be given, and opportunity extended to those present to submit additional nominations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Officers of the Local Council and Their Duties.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The officers of the Local Council are a President, from one to five Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, a Treasurer, an Executive Committee of five or more, a Court of Honor of five, and a Scout Commissioner. The duties of the President, Vice-Presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer are the same as those of similar officers in other organizations. The Executive Committee should consist of these officers and as many more business men as may be necessary for the proper promotion of local affairs. The Court of Honor of a Local Council passes upon the examinations of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>for Merit Badges and reports upon such cases through the Scout Commissioner to the National Council. It investigates all cases of life-saving and presents affidavits to the National Court of Honor for the award of Honor Medals. It also acts as a final court to pass judgment on appeals from opinions and decisions of Scout Masters and their Assistants.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Scout Commissioner and His Duties.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The duties of the Scout Commissioner, who acts as local authority on Scoutcraft and directs the work of the Scout Masters in his community, are really fourfold. He is first of all an executive in his relation to the Local Council. Secondly he acts as the representative of the National Headquarters. In this official capacity he must investigate all applications for Scout Masters&#39; Certificates, seeing that these are issued only to men of good character whose influence will be uplifting; and he must safeguard the sale of the official badges and uniforms so that only boys who have passed the various Scout examinations receive them. Thirdly, as a leader of Scout Masters he organizes and presides at the Scout Masters&#39; Council, which should be composed of the officers of the Local Council and the Scout Masters in the community; plans Scout Masters&#39; meetings; takes the initiative in the promotion and development of new work; outlines courses of instruction for Scout Masters and their patrol leaders; arranges for summer schools for Scout Masters; plan inter-troop meets, games, camps, and in general assists the Scout Masters in putting all the work of the community on a uniform basis. Lastly, the Scout Commissioner acts as an organizer, introducing the scout work in unorganized districts under his jurisdiction, and otherwise continuing the general policy of promotion of the scout work as outlined by the &quot;Committee on Organization,&quot; namely, in keeping up the interest of the public through newspaper articles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Scout Executive.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Executive is the employed officer of the Local Council who devotes his entire time to carrying out the program for Scouting as outlined by the Executive Committee. His duties in the field are defined by the Executive Committee, and he is responsible to the Scout Commissioner for carrying out such activities as may be delegated to him. He should be a man of high ideals and a zealous worker with boys; the employment of such a man has been found absolutely necessary in the larger cities of the country, in order to carry on the work of the district with efficiency and despatch. In some localities, on account of local conditions, the offices of Commissioner and Scout Executive are combined by the vote of the Local Council.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Application for a Charter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At an early date, after the organization of a Local Council and the selection of a Scout Commissioner, application should be made to the National Headquarters for a local charter and for the official appointment of the Scout Commissioner. In making this application, a complete list of officers and members of the Local Council should be submitted together with a statement showing what business and religious interests each member represents in the community. In order to obtain a charter it is necessary to have a Council of at least ten members, but whenever possible it should include many more representative men. All requests for charters should be submitted on a regular application blank which will be supplied by the National Council.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Selection of a Scout Commissioner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Much of the value and success of the Scout work depends upon the proper selection of efficient Scout Commissioners. Every community needs someone to give the Scout Movement direction and act as the local authority on all Scoutcraft matters. In almost every community there is some man who has had considerable experience in out of door life, whose natural qualifications for leadership would commend him for the position of Scout Commissioner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Masters, for the most part, are volunteer workers, and when they give one evening a week, with perhaps a Saturday afternoon in addition, to the boys in their care, they cannot be expected to do much original work in the preparation for Scout meetings. They want to feel that there is someone who knows Scoutcraft better than they, to whom they can go for advice and help. If this advice and help is not forthcoming without a great deal of effort on their part, they are likely to become discouraged and give up their scout work. Therefore, while the Scout Commissioner is usually a volunteer worker, it is essential that he should be able to give considerable time to the work, so that it shall have proper supervision. When a Local Council has secured the services of a capable and efficient man to serve as a Scout Commissioner, he should make proper application to National Headquarters for his official commission. Application blanks will be mailed upon request.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master &#8212; His Duties and Responsibilities.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The officer of the organization in immediate charge of the boys is the Scout Master. He must be at least twentyone years of age, and is usually chosen because of good moral character and interest in the development of boys. He should be genuine in his own life, have the natural ability to lead, and should command the boys&#39; respect and obedience. He need not be an expert on Scoutcraft, but he should at least by personal study and effort seek to keep himself enough in advance of the boys to be prepared on the different topics of study as they are considered in the program; moreover, a good Scout Master will easily progress through his mature comprehension of the work and by his own initiative, and will discover experts to aid him in the various activities. As a leader of the troop, the Scout Master is responsible for its meetings, outings, and general program; he supervises the work of patrol leaders and prepares the members of the troop to take their various scout examinations. He is the representative of the Local Council in charge of a troop, and is responsible to the Council in carrying out the Scout program as outlined in the official &quot; Handbook for Boys,&quot; and for the use of badges, uniforms, and other Scout equipment; but his independence and initiative in his manner of carrying on his work is not to be questioned. It is essential that he consult with the Local Council or Scout Commissioner on every important question that may effect the movement, either locally or nationally.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>The Method of Obtaining a Scout Master&#39;s <br/>               Commission. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A man may apply for commission as Scout Master by filling in properly a blank form similar to that of the Scout Commissioner. This, duly made out, is filed with the secretary of the Local Council with the necessary fee. It is then the duty of the Secretary to bring the application before the Executive Committee of the Local Council for its approval, and having secured such approval to send the application with the proper fee to the National Council Headquarters with a request that a certificate of commission be granted. Where there is no Local Council established, the applicant for the Scout Masters&#39; commission should send the application blank with the requisite fee of<span class='gtxt_body'>
25 cents direct to National Headquarters. Then upon proper investigation through given references of the applicant, the application is passed upon by the Executive Board of the National Council. Blank applications will be mailed upon request.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Assistant Scout Masters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the Scout Master cannot give all the time he would like to in the direction of scout work with his troop, and especially where the membership is large and the boys are anxious to meet oftener than the Scout Master can attend, assistance can be secured through the appointment of Assistant Scout Masters. In such case, these Assistants must be at least eighteen years of age, of good moral character, and acceptable to the Scout Master and Local Council. It is the Assistant Scout Master&#39;s duty to take the place of the Scout Master in the latter&#39;s absence, and to carry out the program under his suggestions and direction. Often young men are appointed to such position after they have reached the age of eighteen and have already been First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts</span>; the step up from one rank to the other is a natural promotion for the energetic and efficient First Class Scout. The Assistant Scout Master fills out an application for commission on a blank very similar in form to that for Scout Masters, and the procedure of application, consideration by the National Executive Board, and appointment by official certificate is the same.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Troops and Patrols.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts, </span>themselves, are organized into troops and their subdivisions, the patrols. A patrol consists of eight boys, one of whom becomes the patrol leader, and another the assistant patrol leader. A troop consists of three or more patrols, but preferably three, as that seems to be the most efficient for working purposes, and a Scout Master can do a great deal better work with a small group of boys than with a large one. It is one of the emphatic rules of the National Organization that boys under the age of twelve years must not be enrolled.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Troop Affiliations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Patrols and troops are usually organized in connection with a Sunday School, boys&#39; club, playground, public school, settlement house, or other local institution. In this case</p>

<a class='page'  id='PA17'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the meeting place is furnished by the organization introducing the Scout work. Under special circumstances and where it is impossible to make use of existing institutions, troops are sometimes organized independently among the boys of the neighborhood. In such case, the first duty of the prospective Scout Master is to secure a club room or meeting place where regular weekly meetings can be held. Better results, however, are generally secured when troops are connected with some well-established institution.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Preliminary Troop Meeting. When arranging a preliminary meeting for the organization of a troop, publicity should be avoided, as otherwise there will probably be more applicants than can be well managed at the preliminary meetings. It is always best to start with a few boys, preferably a patrol, and develop gradually in size and efficiency. A Scout Master should never begin with more boys than can easily be handled and given the first lessons in Scouting. At this first meeting it will usually be found that a goodly proportion of the boys already know something about Scouting, and therefore they should understand that a troop is to be organized because of their personal interest in the Scouting work. They should be put at ease, and their interest and enthusiasm should be encouraged and developed as much as possible. The method of developing the organization should always be natural rather than artificial. Starting with the knowledge already possessed by the boys and their awakened enthusiasm as a basis upon which to build up the Scout work, the Scout Master should proceed naturally in succeeding meetings to enlarge their interest, so as to include the many other things connected with Scouting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The &quot;Daily Good Turn.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As the work develops, the importance of the &quot;Daily Good Turn &quot; and the principles of the Scout Law should be emphasized. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>must be led to realize that much more is expected of a Scout than of any other <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the community; he should know that there is lots of hard work to be done, and that the harder the work, the more good it will do him and the greater the fun.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A Plan for Training Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At the first meeting, after furnishing the boys with application blanks to be filled in and signed by their parents,<span class='gtxt_body'>
it is best to arrange for a definite date of meeting for the purpose of definitely organizing patrols. In a number of places it has proved successful to adjourn this second meeting long enough to allow sufficient time for the training of leaders, who will assist with the organization at the next meeting. Suppose there are twenty-four boys at this first meeting. As soon as practicable six of these boys should be selected as leaders and assistants and organized as a Scout patrol. Then the training of these boys in the Scout principles should be begun at once, preparing them for the Tenderfoot Requirements. When they have successfully passed the examination, the first regular meeting should be called and the whole troop organized into patrols. In this way the twenty-four boys may be formed into three patrols of eight boys each with a trained patrol leader and assistant patrol leader in charge of each. The fact that these leaders have passed the Tenderfoot requirement will give them prestige among the other boys. The leaders should be given real responsibility; they should feel that their special task is to teach, influence, and lead the boys of their patrol. In assigning the boys to the patrols it is advisable to group boys as near the same age as possible, taking into consideration the natural instincts of the boys and their desire for association with one another. This is often a more important factor than age.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Things to Remember.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are several things with which every Scout Master should be familiar in organizing a new troop, namely the official words of caution sent out to each Scout Master through the medium of books, bulletins, and Scout papers from the National Headquarters. These five cautionary measures follow: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Start Efficiently.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. In organizing, begin on a small scale. Do not undertake a greater task than can easily be done with credit. It is better to begin Scouting with a few older boys, giving them careful training in the principles of the movement, so that they in turn may render some assistance in promoting the work among other boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Keep Correct Age-Limit.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Do not enroll boys <i>under twelve years </i>of age. They do not stick and will only lessen the interest of the older<span class='gtxt_body'>
members who really neefl what the Scout work can give them. Scouting is a comprehensive plan of activities to enlist and enlarge the interest and to help the development particularly of the adolescent boys; and boys under twelve are generally too young to understand seriously the principles of Scouting or be materially helped by the movement.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Build Strong Impression of Scout Principles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Do not fail to impress upon the boys the importance of the Scout Oath, Scout Laws, and the requirements for the various degrees. While there is some danger in making the examination so hard as to discourage the class of boys who need the work most, yet you must guard against any tendency to make the tests too easy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Be Original in Meetings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Do not undertake at the beginning to give the boys everything there is in Scoutcraft. Work out your own plan with the boys from time to time, carefully avoiding a stereotyped form of meeting at each session, and always reserving something of interest for the next meeting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Urge Ideal of Peace Scouting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. The primary object of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America is not military, but Peace Scouting and educational character-building for good citizenship.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>SCOUT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>By </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Samuel </span>A. <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Moffat, </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>National Field Scout Commissioner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Test Requirements.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Hardly a day passes but that one or more <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>write to National Headquarters asking for additional information about someone of the requirements for the Tenderfoot, Second Class or First Class Scout tests. All the requirements for the different Scout ranks are fully outlined on pp. 16-18 of the &quot;Handbook for Boys.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Tenderfoot Requirements.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In discussing this subject, however, it should be understood that no deviation from the requirements for these degrees as set forth in the Handbook will be permitted unless in extraordinary cases, such as physical inability and where the written consent of National Headquarters has been obtained by the recognized local authorities. It is very important that the standard of requirements be maintained and that boys in all parts of the country be required to pass the same set of tests in order to be enrolled as Second Class or First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>In fact, the Scout badge should give assurance that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>wearing it is capable of doing the things that are the measure of a Scout. Even if excused by the Scout Master from passing one of the required tests a Scout would feel that he were sailing under false colors if forced to confess his inability to do that particular thing. Even if the requirement seems hard, persistent effort and the exercise of a little patience should enable one <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to meet the requirements as well as any other <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>It should always be kept in mind that what has been accomplished by one can usually be accomplished by another fellow if he but <i>wills </i>to do it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Very frequently some Scout who finds it hard to learn to swim appeals to his Scout Master to write to the Na<span class='gtxt_body'>tional Headquarters for a substitute. This is wrong. Every Scout, every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>for that matter, should know how to swim. Swimming is conceded to be the most graceful of all physical exercises and furnishes a better all-round development than any other sport. Besides being a personal safeguard, it prepares the Scout for service in saving the lives of others. There is no good reason why a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should be excused from meeting so necessary a requirement, except possibly the fact that he is physically unfit. Even then it would be far better for a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to enlist the care of a competent physician to help him regain his health to meet this requirement before he undertakes to complete the examination for his First Class badge.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Tenderfoot.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The requirements for the Tenderfoot degree are for the purpose of giving the newly elected Scout a clear idea of the principles of the movement which he is joining. In reality the Tenderfoot is not a Scout at all. He is only a &quot;green-horn&quot; who has taken out his first papers, and is placed upon probation to become familiar with the laws that govern <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>everywhere and to put into practice in daily life principles that will enable him to become resourceful, self-reliant, and of service to others.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Age Limit.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This statement prefaces the requirements for the Tenderfoot degree, &quot;To become a Scout a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>must be at least twelve years of age.&quot; This does not mean that a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>be &quot; in his twelfth year &quot; but that he has actually passed his twelfth birthday. The requirements of the Scout Movement are such that only the older boys are capable of properly understanding them. The hikes and endurance tests are too severe for younger boys. The two classes of boys care for entirely different sports and activities and it is not fair to the older boys of the patrol to be handicapped by youngsters who cannot keep up with the requirements. The underlying principle of Scouting is the development of community interest among boys. Community interest awakens with adolescence. There is as little toleration for the younger <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>by older boys as there is among men for the youth of eighteen or nineteen. In fact, it is quite generally true that the older <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will not associate with boys whom he considers &quot;mere kids.&quot; It would be, therefore,</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA22'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>unfair to the organization to limit its effectiveness in dealing with adolescent problems, by seeking to enroll boys under twelve years of age.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master is placed upon his honor not to violate this fundamental requirement. The age limit, therefore, has been fixed at twelve as the youngest age at which a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>may join a patrol of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>During the period of organization of the Scout Movement in this country some boys under twelve were admitted to patrols and are now of Tenderfoot rank. It would not be fair to ask them to withdraw, but it is only right that they should not become Second Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>until they have reached their twelfth birthday. In the future, however, no <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>under twelve will be allowed to join the organization. This is one of the hard and fast rules that Scout Masters are asked to live up to and in fairness to others no one should ask that an exception be made. Junior Scout clubs will not be officially recognized.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Knowing the Scout Oath and Law.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The first requirement for the Tenderfoot is that he know the Scout law, sign, salute and the significance of the badge. These are fully explained on pages 12 to 16 of the &quot;Handbook for Boys.&quot; The question is often asked in what sense the Scout should know these things. Should he memorize word for word so as to be able to repeat each law and the interpretation of it, or should he be able to give the meaning of each law as he understands it? It is not the purpose that a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>be able to repeat these laws as he would poetry, but that he may so firmly fix in his heart and mind that a Scout is trustworthy, courteous, clean, etc., that these may become part of his daily thought and life. It is better for a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to learn every word of these laws and to repeat them daily until his habits of living become firmly set than to allow any Tenderfoot (having learned them for that purpose only) to take his test and thereafter to forget all about them. Similarly the Scout Oath is an obligation that should not be taken lightly by the Tenderfoot, who should never have to confess that he has forgotten the three planks. The various parts of the badge, the trefoil, the eagle, the scroll and the knot are constant reminders of his obligation as a Scout, and he should be able to explain their significance.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Composition and History of the Flag.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The second requirement is that he know the composition and history of the National Flag and the customary forms of respect due to it. The following brief history has been prepared to meet th1s requirement. It is merely suggestive and should only be used as a basis for further knowledge of the National Flag The customary forms of respect are suggested by the Sons of the Revolution, State of New York.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>History fails to inform us who first suggested the idea for the composition of the National Flag. Some writers claim that the design was suggested by George Washington&#39;s coat of arms, while others say that the stripes were taken from the thirteen stripes in the banner of the Philadelphia Troop of Light Horse. The story, however, most generally accepted, is that the first flag was planned and made in 1776 by Betsy Ross, who kept an upholstery shop on Arch Street, Philadelphia, and that this, a year later, was adopted by Congress. The special committee appointed to design a national flag consisted of George Washington,<span class='gtxt_body'>
Robert Morris, and Col. George Ross, uncle of the late husband of Betsy Ross. The star that the committee decided upon had six points, but Mrs. Ross advised the five-pointed star, which has ever since been used in the United States flag. The flag thus designed was colored by a local artist, and from this colored copy Betsy Ross made the first American flag. (See B. H., pp. 339-340.)</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The first time that the new flag of the United States was carried in battle was at Forf Stanwix, named Fort Schuyler, where Rome, New York, now stands. The first salute ever given &quot;Old Glory&quot; by a foreign power, was when the <i>Ranger, </i>commanded by Captain Paul Jones, entered a French harbor in 1778 and received a salute from the harbor forts. When Washington was in command at Cambridge, in January, 1776, the flag used by him consisted of a banner of thirteen red and white stripes with the British Union Jack in the upper left-hand corner. This was known as the great union flag. For a period of seventy years preceding the War of the Revolution the flag generally used by the American colonies was made up of the red cross of Saint George, representing England, and a white cross, which represented Scotland. This was known as the Union Flag. During the first two years of the Revolutionary War all kinds of battle flags were carried on land and sea. These were of various designs and their emblems represented local sentiment. Every Colony and almost every section had its special flag. One of the most famous of these was a yellow flag with the emblem of a rattlesnake and the motto, &quot;Do not tread on me,&quot; underneath it. Also two trees are closely associated with the history of the flag, the pine and the elm. One of these was a reproduction of an old elm which stood on the corner of what is now Washington and Essex Streets, Boston. This was known as the &quot;liberty&quot; tree and was the scene of many patriotic meetings. On November 3rd, 1773, the citizens of Boston gathered under this tree to consider resolutions protesting against the Stamp Act. This resolution being ignored, resulted in the famous Boston Tea Party, December 6th, 1773. The pine tree also appeared on the silver coins of the Massachusetts colonies as early as 1650.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The official history of our flag begins on June 14, 1777, when the American Congress adopted the following resolution proposed by John Adams:</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Content from Google Book Search, generated at 1301352751410157 -->
<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA25'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Resolved: That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: that the Union be thirteen stars, white on a blue field, representing a new constellation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;We take,&quot; said Washington, &quot; the star from Heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing liberty.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In designing the flag there was much discussion as to the arrangement of the stars in the field of blue. It was thought at one time that a new stripe as well as a new star should be added for each new State admitted to the Union. Indeed, in 1794, Congress passed an act to the effect that on and after May 1, 1795, &quot; the flag of the United States be fifteen stripes, alternate red and white; and that the union be fifteen stars, white in a field of blue. These additional stars and stripes were for the States of Vermont and Kentucky.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The impracticability of adding a stripe for each State was apparent as other States began to be admitted. Moreover, the flag of fifteen stripes, it was thought, did not properly represent the Union; therefore, on April 4, 1818, after a period of twenty-one years in which the flag of fifteen stripes had been used, Congress passed an act which finally fixed the general flag of our country, which reads as follows:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>An Act to Establish the Flag of the United States.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sec. 1. Be it enacted, etc. That from and after the fourth day of July next, the flag of the United States be thirteen horizontal stripes, alternate red and white; that the union have twenty stars, white in a blue field.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sec. 2. Be it further enacted, that, on the admission of every new state into the union, one star be added to the union of the flag; and that such addition shall take effect on the fourth day of July succeeding such admission.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Respect Due to the Flag.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>i The customary forms of respect due the flag are:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>1. </i>It should not be hoisted before sunrise nor allowed to remain up after sunset.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>2. </i>At &quot;retreat,&quot; sunset, civilian spectators should stand at attention and give the military salute.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. When the national colors are passing on parade or review, the spectators should, if walking, halt, and if sitting, rise and stand at attention and uncover.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>4. </i>When the flag is flown at half staff as a sign of<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Knowledge of Knot-Tying.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The third requirement is not at all difficult. If the Scout will secure a piece of rope two or three feet long and sit down with the Handbook before him lie will find it very easy to follow the instructions for making any of the required knots given on pages 48-52. Rope is much better for knot-tying practice than either string or cord. Having met these requirements he takes the Scout oath, is enrolled as a Tenderfoot and is entitled to wear the Tenderfoot badge.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Second Class Scout Requirements.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Passing from the requirements for a Tenderfoot to the set of tests outlined for a Second Class Scout, the aim and purpose of the work changes materially. Up to this point attention has been paid only to the uninitiated &#8212; the Tenderfoot in fact as well as in name, who knowing nothing of the life of a Scout or the things required of a Scout, has been seeking initiation into the mysteries of the craft. But having imbibed the spirit of Scouting and having put into practice in daily life the Scout Law, the candidate is prepared to take the second step in his development along scout lines. He acknowledges his limitations and lack of knowledge and confesses his need of further training so that he may the better &quot; Be Prepared&quot; for further service to others. The second class requirements, therefore, are so arranged, as to meet this need. By means of them it is hoped to cultivate in boys, habits of observation, resourcefulness, thrift, and ability to adapt one&#39;s self to conditions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If it were necessary to warn the prospective Tenderfoot against obtaining merely a superficial knowledge of the Tenderfoot requirements, it is doubly important to remind him of the necessity of thoroughly mastering the requirements of the Second Class Scout. It is only by daily exercise that habits become our servants and unconscientiously serve us in times of need.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Tenderfoot Service. Test No. 1 calls for at least one month&#39;s service as a Tenderfoot. This does not mean one month from the time of application for membership in the patrol, but that from the time the Scout took the oath of a Tenderfoot and was invested with the badge of that degree, he has for at least one month put into practice in daily life the scout ideals.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>First Aid.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 2 calls for a knowledge of Elementary First Aid and Bandaging. It is not the purpose of the Scout Movement to develop a lot of amateur doctors, but to give <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>sufficient information on the subject of First Aid to enable them to act quickly in cases of emergency. They should be able at any opportunity to give sufficient help to prevent the patient receiving any further harm in cases of fractures, fits, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the case of a serious accident, the first thing to do is to send for the nearest doctor. If the nature of the injury is known, the messenger should be informed so that the doctor may come prepared to deal with the case. In many instances the most that can be done, until the doctor arrives, is to relieve the patient by placing something under his head, unbuttoning his clothes and keeping back the crowd so that he may have sufficient air. In case of a fracture, if it is necessary to remove the patient, care should be taken to adjust the splints so that no further damage can be done.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Detailed instruction in a number of these requirements is given so clearly in the &quot;Handbook for Boys&quot; that without reproducing the information here, it will be enough to refer by page number to the Handbook in such cases.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Tracking.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 4 calls for the ability to track half a mile in twenty-five minutes, or, if in town, to describe satisfactorily the contents of one store window out of four observed for one minute each. Pages 187-201 of the &quot;Handbook for Boys&quot; furnish excellent information on tracking.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For the purpose of this test a trail may be previously laid by the Scout Master or Examining Committee covering at least half a mile. The candidate for examination may then be started out over that trail and allowed to follow up its devious windings until he arrives at the other end. Care should be taken&quot; to see that he is able to keep to the trail for the entire distance and to make the distance in the time required. As this test is given to develop the power of observation, the game called &quot; Shop Window Out-Doors in Town&quot; is usually played in cities where it is not always convenient to follow the tracking requirements. This is fully described on p. 309 of the Boys&#39; Handbook. &quot;Kim&#39;s Game&quot; is equally good, p. 311.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Much information, however, can be obtained from examining tracks. It is important that the Scout learn to read them correctly. He should tell at a glance whether a man was walking or running or whether a horse was walking, trotting, cantering, or galloping. In following a horse&#39;s tracks, note the difference between the impressions made by the hind and the fore feet. Tracks of different horses vary. Tracks of some horses may even seem different when the horse is being held in or being given free rein. Impressions of a horse&#39;s feet are usually seen in pairs; and the impressions of the hind feet are smaller than those of the fore feet. An eminent authority on tracking gives the following valuable information: &quot;When a horse is walking, the impressions made are separate and there is a distance of 2J-4 feet between the toe of the one fore foot and the heel of the other fore foot. When trotting the impressions are touching each other and the distance between the fore feet is about 4)4 feet. When galloping the impressions are much deeper and much farther apart. With the average-sized horse the distance between the fore feet is over 10 feet.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In making observations the following points should be noted:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>1. </i>Whether all tracks run in the same direction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Content from Google Book Search, generated at 1301352754915156 -->
<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA30'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>2. </i>Whether there is any indication of the number of men or horses that have formed the tracks.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>J. </i>Whether the tracks are quite recent and if all are of the same period. (Of course atmospheric conditions must be taken into account as tracks will be affected by rain, heavy dew or dry winds.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>4. </i>Whether the whole party was moving at a uniform rate.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Whether the tracks of any wheeled vehicle are visible, and if so, whether heavy or light.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>6. </i>In what formation the party was moving.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>7. </i>Whether any side tracks leave the main trail at any point.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'><i>8. </i>Whether any halting places are visible. <br/>p. Whether any camping places are visible. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>should practice this method of observation and after noting these points and others, write their own story of just what occurred. To improve his power of tracking every Scout should take constant opportunities to follow up tracks of different kinds on the ground, drawing inferences from them and, whenever possible, verifying any conclusions he may have drawn.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Scout&#39;s Pace.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 5 calls for the ability to go a mile in twelve minutes at Scout&#39;s pace. Scout&#39;s pace is fifty yards run</p>
</div>
<div class='gimg_graphic'>
<img height="189" width="353" src="http://books.google.com/books?id=BykKAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;q=boy+scouts&amp;cds=1&amp;sig=ACfU3U29kTu8jF-ASknQU9dha-sdiFnXPg&amp;edge=0&amp;edge=stretch&amp;w=353&amp;h=189&amp;ci=35,910,881,471" alt="[graphic][table][merged small]" /></div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ning and fifty yards walking. It is a method of travel which permits of endurance when covering a long distance.<span class='gtxt_body'>
To pass the test it should be noted that the mile is to be traversed in twelve minutes. This is not a record for the distance because it can be easily accomplished by almost any Scout in eight minutes. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who does it in less than twelve minutes fails equally with the boys who take fifteen minutes to do it. The object of this test is to practice Scout&#39;s pace until a Scout knows that whenever he keeps up that given pace for twelve minutes he has covered exactly one mile. Or on the other hand, a Scout should know that whenever he has covered one mile at that given pace, he has taken just exactly twelve minutes to do it. It is a measure of distance and time rather than a record for the mile.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Use of Knife and Hatchet.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 6 prescribes the proper use of knife and hatchet, which are about the most useful implements of a backwoodsman. In fact a good camper, hunter or mountaineer would be lost without them. The manner in which a camper handles his knife or ax is a sure sign whether he knows anything about woodcraft or not. It is only the unskilled and untrained who brandish an open knife or carelessly handle unsheathed axes; experienced men are always extremely careful in their use. These two tools should be carried not as playthings but for serious work whenever they are required. Owing to the great danger of injury by the indiscriminate use of the Scout ax before the boys have received proper instruction, many troops permit the Scout ax to be carried by the Patrol Leader only and the rest of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>are permitted to add the ax to their equipment after they have passed this requirement and have become Second Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>It is important that the following advice about the proper use of the knife and hatchet be noted.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>1. </i>They should be properly taken care of and never used upon objects or for purposes that will dull or break them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>2. </i>They should be handled in such a way as not to injure the user or any person nearby.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>, <i>2- </i>They should never be used to strip the bark off birch, beech or madrone trees or to disfigure other people&#39;s property by cutting initials thereon.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>4. </i>The correct methods of handling the knife and</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA32'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>hatchet should be learned by each Scout at his earliest opportunity. The same also applies to the axe.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>WHEN USING THE KNIFE.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>1. </i>Don&#39;t whittle toward you.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>2. </i>Don&#39;t drive a knife into a stick by hammering on the back of it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>j. Don&#39;t use it on wood with nails in it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>4. </i>Don&#39;t put the knife blade into the fire.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Don&#39;t pry open a knife blade.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>6. </i>Don&#39;t use it as a screw driver.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. Don&#39;t carry an open knife in your hand.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>8. </i>Don&#39;t lay it on the ground when not using it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>WHEN USING THE AX.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>1. </i>Never chop in such a position that the ax will cut you if it slips.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>2. </i>Never hold a piece of wood, to be split, with your foot.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Never chop through wood on a hard surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>4. </i>Never chop pine or hemlock knots with a sharp ax.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. In throwing a tree, always cut it low and deep on the side toward which you want it to fall. Making a cut nearly through on this side and then a couple of blows on the other side at a higher level, will throw the tree where you want it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>6. </i>If you carry an ax on your shoulder, always have the edge outward from your neck. Otherwise you might stumble and be killed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. Always muzzle the ax in traveling.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>An expert axman can chop with either the right hand or the left hand. When he is chopping left handed, the right hand is at the left and the left hand slides and vice versa.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Fire-Making.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 7 calls for the ability to lay and light a fire in the open using not more than two matches. The beginner usually makes the mistake of trying to start with too large a fire. First collect sufficient wood and then with hatchet&#39; or knife cut a large enough quantity into fine shavings that will easily catch fire. When the first small quantity is</p>

<a class='page'  id='PA33'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>thoroughly ablaze, continue to add more fuel until it is safe to put on the large pieces of wood. A fire should not be lighted in a hollow where there is absolutely no wind as a fair draught is needed to fan it. When the fire has been thoroughly started, place some logs at the back, that is, at the side opposite to which the wind is coming. Gradually logs may be placed at the sides thereby forming a little channel for the bed of the fire in which the draught may have a clear sweep. In very wet or stormy weather the fire may be started with small chips taken from the center of a log of wood. These can be placed in a tin can or water pail until the fire has been obtained. In lighting the Scout fire with two matches, the use of paper is prohibited.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Cooking. Test No. 8 calls for the ability to cook a quarter of a pound of meat and two potatoes without the aid of ordinary kitchen utensils. This means of course that the cooking must be accomplished in the open upon the fire which has been built with the two matches, and under conditions that usually obtain while camping in the woods. The ordinary kitchen utensils that are prohibited are merely the household articles that are used when cooking indoors. The Scout may use his mess kit or such other helps that he would ordinarily find in camp in the woods.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Dollar Bank-Deposit.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 9 prescribes that the Scout earn and deposit one dollar in a public bank. There are several important things to be noted regarding this requirement. First, the purpose of it all is to cultivate the habit of thrift. It is not sufficient that a Scout may have earned more than one dollar in times past before he became a Second Class Scout and is credited with a bank account, but it is necessary that from the time of his initiation as a Tenderfoot he has earned one dollar which he has deposited to his credit as a Scout. But it would be far better if the Scout without stopping here pledged himself to make this dollar the basis of a bank account which he hopes to develop during his lifetime. It is certainly contrary to the spirit of the requirement for any <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to earn and deposit a dollar in the bank and then withdraw it as soon as the test has been passed.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Sixteen Points of the Compass.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Test No. 10 calls for the knowledge of the sixteen principal points of the compass. In order to facilitate the gaining of that knowledge describe a complete circle on the ground. Take the position at the center in the hub. The point directly ahead may be marked North; the point directly at the back will be South; the direction to the right will be East; and the position of the left hand, or a straight line through from the East will be West. This divides the circle into four equal parts of 90 degrees each. These are the four primary points of the compass. If a line were drawn directly between the North and East and continued through the hub of the circle it would bisect the South and West. The point midway between the North and East is called N. E. and the point between the South and the West is called S. W. Another line drawn between the North and West through the center would be known as N. W. and the S. E. respectively. This then gives the eight principal points of the compass, but the task is to secure sixteen. These are at once obtained by drawing lines between the N. and N. E., between E. and N. E., between E. and S. E., S. and S. E., etc. These lines if continued across the circle or directly through the hub to the other side will give the full sixteen points. The line between N. and N. E. is known as N. N. E. The line between E. and N. E. is known as E. N. E., and so on around the circle. The Scout will easily learn these points by this method, and a few practical demonstrations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Requirements for First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Turning from the discussion of Second Class Scout requirements to the consideration of those for First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>it is to be noted that as the Scout works higher in rank, there is more and more need of standardizing requirement details. A consideration of First Class Scout requirements presents many new points for discussion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Purpose of First Class Scout Requirements.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The First Class Scout tests are intended to teach the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>his obligation as an individual in the community so that he may properly cooperate with others for the public welfare and render public service wherever it is needed. This ability to cooperate with others in doing the little things will enable a Scout later on to assume his position one day<span class='gtxt_body'>
as a leader. The ultimate aim of every Scout should be leadership.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA35'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Occasionally boys who are sixteen or seventeen years old write to the National Office asking if they must give up scout work after they have reached their eighteenth birthday, or if they may continue in the movement as First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>While the age at which a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>may join the movement is fixed at twelve years there is no stated age at which he must resign as a Scout. If he has been properly trained as a Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class Scout, it seems reasonable to suppose that by the time he has reached his eighteenth birthday he will have acquired such a thorough knowledge of Scoutcraft that he will be prepared to take his place as an Assistant Scout Master, to continue for others the training which he has found helpful to himself. The movement is depending upon the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>now in training to assume leadership as Assistant Scout Masters and Scout Masters for the boys who succeed them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Several of the First Class Scout requirements are merely a continuation of the course of instruction given Second Class </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts. </i></span><i>Very little further can be said about these requirements. Practice alone is needed to qualify in passing these tests. This is particularly true of signaling, first aid work and cooking. In some cases where the Handbook gives detailed information about the requirement, it is thought best to simply refer to the page without repeating such information. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Swimming.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. &quot;Swim fifty yards.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Inasmuch as a Scout should be prepared to care for himself under all circumstances and be capable of rendering service to others when in danger it would seem almost of first importance that he know how to swim. The Scout camp presents a wonderful opportunity to learn the art. Many times it is possible for the Scout Master to make arrangements for his boys to use a pool in some local club house during the winter. Unfortunately there are some troops so situated that provisions for swimming are very limited. But, this requirement is considered so valuable to the individual <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>that even though he is capable of passing every other test it is advisable that he learn to swim before becoming a First Class Scout. To pass the test it is necessary that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>be able to swim by whatever stroke<span class='gtxt_body'>
he has learned a distance of fifty yards without assistance from anyone and without holding on to any object or touching bottom during the distance.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Two Dollars in the Bank.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. &quot;Earn and deposit at least two dollars in a public bank.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the Scout has followed instructions regarding the earning of one dollar for his Second Class Scout test, it is safe to assume that he will add to that amount another dollar and thus begin a savings account. The requirement is not intended to mean that he should have two dollars in addition to the one already deposited for Second Class Scout tests, but only that he add another dollar to the first one in the bank. If, however, he has withdrawn his deposit he should by all means earn two dollars more to meet the requirement. But the Scout should not stop here; he should make this deposit the basis for the savings of a lifetime.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Signaling.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. &quot;Send and receive a message by semaphore or American Morse or Myer Alphabet, sixteen letters per minute.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Practice alone is needed. The difficult part of this requirement is not in the sending, but in receiving the message. It is not sufficient that once in a while the Scout may have the luck to take a message at the rate of sixteen letters per minute; the test should be a longer message of fifty or one hundred words which will demonstrate the ability to take down this message at the required average.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Big Hike.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. &quot;Make a round trip alone (or with another Scout) to a point at least seven miles away, going on foot or rowing a boat, and write a satisfactory account of the trip and things observed.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By all means a route should be selected that takes the Scout into the woods, over mountains or through uninhabited territory where he may be alone with the great outdoors. Anyone can take a walk through crowded towns or city streets but the inspiration once felt by the bravehearted Scout who has gone out into the virgin forest is an experience to be highly coveted.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The purpose of this requirement is to test one&#39;s ability in</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA37'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>observation, and to prove how dependable the Scout is in giving the account of his experience. Speed is of no importance. In fact the more leisurely the trip is made the better able the Scout will be to tell all the things en-, countered on the journey and describe all of the details of the route traveled. If two <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>travel together it would be interesting for both to keep independent reports of the things observed. At the end of the journey it will be surprising to see the number of things which one observed that the other did not see and vice versa. Moreover, if the Scout travels this route a second time he might be astonished at the number of things observed on the second trip that was overlooked the first time. The ability to note details will prove invaluable throughout life. Such trips as these should be taken frequently.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Do not overlook the words &quot;as may be directed.&quot; It is not intended that the Scout should choose <i>any </i>two articles.

He may be directed by the Examining Committee to cook a hunter&#39;s stew and a twist baked on a stick. In the chapter on Campcraft in the Handbook cooking recipes are given for eggs, bacon, fish and pancakes, pp. 149-152. The recipes for the other dishes are given herewith: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Hunter&#39;s Stew: &#8212; To make a hunter&#39;s stew, chop the meat into small chunks about an inch or one and one-half inches square. Then scrape and chop up any vegetables that are easily obtained,&#8212; potatoes, turnips, carrots, onions, etc.; and put them into the mess kit, adding clean water, or soup, till the mess kit is half full. Mix some flour, salt and pepper together and rub the meat well into the mixture, then place this in the mess kit or kettle, seeing that there is just sufficient water to cover the food,&#8212; and no more. The stew should be ready after simmering for about an hour and a quarter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To cook a fowl: &#8212; In preparing a fowl or bird of some description it is unnecessary to remove the feathers. After removing the entrails and cleaning the inside, plaster the fowl over w1th a mixture of clay, earth, ashes, etc., and place it in the middle of the fire. When sufficiently cooked knock off the coating of clay, and the feathers will come away with it, leaving the chicken or bird deliciously ready for the eating.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Rabbit Stew: &#8212; A rabbit (cottontail, jack rabbit, or<span class='gtxt_body'>
hare) is a form of food that is likely to come in the way of a Scout, so every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should know how to cook one. Having removed the skin and cleaned the inside, cut the rabbit into pieces and place in the mess kit with sufficient water to cover it, adding pepper and salt and sliced onion. Stew gently for about an hour, and when done thicken with about a tablespoon of flour.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Hoecake:&#8212;Make a thick batter by mixing warm (not scalding) water or milk with one pint of corn meal, and mix in with this a small teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of melted lard. To cook hoecake properly, the frying pan should be perfectly clean and smooth inside. If it is not, too much grease will be required in cooking. Scrape it after each panful is cooked, and then only occasional greasing will be required. Greasing is best done with a clean rag containing butter. Spread a thin batter in the pan with a spoon so that the cake will be very thin; disturb it as little as possible and when the cake is firm on one side turn it and cook on the other.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Biscuit: &#8212; (See Kephart&#39;s &quot;Camp Cookery&quot; and also Kephart&#39;s &quot;Book of Camping and Woodcraft,&quot; pp. 118119.) Just as good biscuits or johnnycake can be baked before a log fire in the woods as in a kitchen range. Bread making is a chemical process. Follow directions, pay close attention to details as - a chemist does, from building the fire to testing the loaf with a sliver. It requires experience or a special knack to <i>guess </i>quantities, but none at all to measure them. In general, biscuit or other small cakes should be baked quickly by a rapid or ardent heat; large loaves require a slower, more even heat, so that the outside will not harden until the inside is nearly done. For a dozen biscuits use: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>i<span class="gstxt_sup">l</span>/<span class="gstxt_sub">2</span> </i>pints flour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>iy<span class="gstxt_sub">2</span> </i>heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'><i>  <span class="gstxt_sup">l</span>/<span class="gstxt_sub">2</span> </i>heaping teaspoonful salt. <br/>1 heaping tablespoon cold grease. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>y<span class="gstxt_sub">2</span> </i>pint cold water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The amount of water varies according to the quality of flour. Too much water makes the dough sticky and prolongs the baking. Baking powders vary in strength; the directions on the can should be followed in each case.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Mix thoroughly with a big spoon or wooden paddle, first<span class='gtxt_body'>
the baking powder with the flour and then the salt. Rub into this the cold grease (which may be lard, cold pork fat or drippings) until there are no lumps left and no grease adhering to bottom of the pan. This is a little tedious, but it doesn&#39;t pay to shirk it; complete stirring is necessary for success. Then stir in the water and work it with the spoon until the result is rather a stiff dough. Squeeze or mold the dough as little as possible; because the gas that makes the biscuit light is already forming and</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Twist&quot; baked on a stick: &#8212; Work the dough, prepared as for biscuit, into a ribbon two inches wide. Get a club of sweet green wood (birch, sassafras, poplar or maple) about two feet long and three inches thick, peel the large end, and sharpen the other and stick it into the ground, leaning toward fire. When the sap simmers wind the dough spirally around the peeled end. Turn occasionally while baking. Several sticks can be baking at once. Bread enough for one man&#39;s meal can be quickly baked in this way on a peeled stick as thick as a broomstick, holding it over fire and turning it from time to time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The applicant for First Class Scout rank should be familiar enough with these recipes to be able to take another Second Class Scout out and teach him how to cook any or all of these articles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Map Reading.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. &quot;Read a map correctly and draw from field notes made on the spot an intelligible rough sketch map, indicating by Jheir proper marks important buildings, roads, trolleys, main landmarks, principal elevations, etc. Point out a compass direction without the help of a compass.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To read a map correctly the first thing necessary is to make note of the scale used. By the term <i>scale </i>is meant the proportion which a certain distance between any two objects on the map bears to the country it represents. The scale may be represented by -&#8212;&quot; ten inches to a mile&quot; which means that a road which is ten inches long on the map is a mile long in reality. After getting the scale distance properly in mind, locate the north point or direction. In some maps true north is indicated by a star, while an arrow shows the magnetic north point. In all ordinance maps the left and right hand sides of the map from the bottom to the top run true north. It is necessary when reading a map to be able to ascertain if one point is visible from another point. To do so intelligently requires an understanding of contours and contour lines. The height</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In drawing a rough sketch map, clearness of perception is the chief requisite, and nothing should be put in that is</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>unnecessary for the full understanding of the sketch. As each individual would most likely have a different way of showing the various things in the map, such as houses, roads, trees, etc., certain &quot; conventional signs&quot; are generally used for such purposes. These can be secured by addressing the Army War College, Washington, D. C, or usually by application to the office of a surveyor or abstractor. A few such signs are shown in the following illustrations:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In drawing a rough sketch map, the following principal points should be noted:&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Margin: -&#8212;- Leave a margin of at least an inch all around the sketch.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scale: &#8212; Always state the foot scale of the map. Direction: &#8212; Remember that the map will be practically useless unless the north point is shown to indicate direction.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. &quot;Use properly an ax for felling or trimming light timber; or produce an article of carpentry or cabinet-making or metal work made by himself. Explain the method followed.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The first part of this requirement was fully described in the discussion of Test 6 of the Second Class Scout tests. A word of caution should be inserted here however. <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>should not fell trees except under the direction of their Scout Master who will always see that permission is granted by the proper authorities before this is done. A Scout should always respect property rights and avoid violating any of the State forestry regulations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The ability to produce an article of carpentry or metal work comes only from practical experience in handicraft work. This should be taken up under the personal instruction of some teacher provided or recommended by the Scout Master &#8212; some expert craftsman who is willing to give the boys all the knowledge he can.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>9. &quot;Judge distance, size, number, height and weight within twenty-five per cent.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Read carefully the material contained on page 64 of the official Handbook on the subject of measuring distances. Every Scout should know to an inch what is his usual pace when walking and running. Judging short distances should be practiced first, and then the lengths gradually extended. Begin by judging objects twenty yards away; then increase the distance ten yards at a time until any space a hundred yards in length or so can be estimated. It must be remembered that the distance is judged from the eye to the object without taking into account the contour of the intervening ground. The following points should be consistently kept in mind and studied in judging distances: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The range of objects is usually overestimated:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. When kneeling or lying.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. When the background and the object are of a sim</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ilar color.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. On broken ground.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. In avenues, long streets, or ravines.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. When the object is in the shade.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. In mist or failing light, or when heat is rising from</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the ground.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. When the object is only partly seen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Points to be noted. The range of objects is usually under-estimated :&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. When the sun is behind the observer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. When the atmosphere is clear.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. When the background and the object are of dif</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ferent colors.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. When the ground is level or covered with snow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. When looking over water or a deep chasm.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. When looking upward or downward. It is further worth noting that: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At 50 yards the mouth and eyes of a man can be</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>       clearly seen. <br/>At 100 yards the eyes appear as points. <br/>At 200 yards buttons and any bright ornament can be <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>       seen. <br/>At 300 yards the face can be seen. <br/>At 400 yards the movement of legs can be seen. <br/></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Chapter II of the Handbook was written with the ex<span class='gtxt_body'>press purpose of enabling the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to learn something of trees and plants, wild birds, and animal life. This chapter should be studied carefully. Further information on these subjects can be secured at any public library, or from encyclopedias, etc. The best way to become familiar with trees and birds is to go into the woods with an instructor and have him point out typical life-types of trees and bird life. Such knowledge is first hand and most easily remembered. It will not be possible for most of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>to observe the habits of wild animals in their native haunts, but many boys may some time visit a Zoological Garden in some large city and learn something of the animals there. Close observation of any form of outdoor life will prove of great interest to the observer, and create in him a desire for a more thorough knowledge of the great Outdoors.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Poison Oak and Poison Ivy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This requirement calls for a knowledge of poison ivy. In some parts of the country this dangerous little plant is not found, but its place is usually taken by poison oak, or some other such similar shrub. In such case the Scout should be able to describe the plant by its bark, leaves, flowers, fruit, scent, etc., as for other species of plants.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Star Constellations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Almost every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is familiar with the Big Dipper. Many boys can even point out the Little Dipper and other constellations. When these have once been pointed out to a Scout he will never forget them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The North Star or Polaris is the bright star in the handle of the Little Dipper. It may be located by continuing the line in the outer side of the bowl of the Big Dipper about five times its own length.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>While the outline of the Little Dipper is not always clear, the North Star and the two outer stars on the bowl of the Little Dipper are usually bright. These two outer stars are known as the &quot;Guardians of the Pole.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On the opposite side of the pole star from the Big Dipper at about the same distance will be found a bright constellation known as &quot; Cassiopeia&#39;s Chair.&quot; It is formed by six stars, five of which are bright enough to be seen on any clear night. These five take the shape of an irregular &quot;W.&quot; The location of this constellation is to be noted.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The most wonderful combination of stars in the heavens<span class='gtxt_body'>
is known as &quot;Orion.&quot; There are several brilliant stars in this constellation. The Handbook, page 84, gives an excellent drawing of this star group. Orion&#39;s head points directly to the North Star and the sword in his belt points directly to the South Pole.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The Real Test in Scouting &#8212; Assimilation of Scout Principles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>11. &quot;Furnish satisfactory evidence that he has put into practice in his daily life the principles of the Scout oath and law.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>After all. Scouting does not consist in the wearing of a khaki uniform decorated with badges of various degrees. Unless the Scout has caught the spirit of the early Pioneers, the Frontier <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>or the Knights of old, and has thereby become trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent, he has certainly failed in meeting the requirements necessary to become a First Class Scout. It is not even sufficient that the Scout be satisfied with himself along these lines. This requirement is intended to furnish evidence as to what other people think of him. The parents at home, the teachers at school, and other associates should give evidence that the Scout can be counted on more than the ordinary <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who is not a Scout. This is the kind of evidence that the Scout Master is asked to obtain before passing the applicant in the requirements of the First Class Scout.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Training Others.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>12. &quot;Enlist a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>trained by himself in the requirements of a Tenderfoot.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Here is the first opportunity to be of real service to another. Thousands of boys are awaiting an opportunity to become <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>but owing to the great scarcity of Scout Masters and the need of trained <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>who can give real assistance in training others in Scoutcraft, these boys are deprived of the privilege of joining a troop and becoming a member of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America. When the Scout is ready to pass his final test and finds some <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who wants to become a Scout he should give him sufficient instruction to enable him to pass the Tenderfoot requirements. If for some good reason he cannot join the same troop the first rank applicant should help to find some man in his neigh</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>borhood who will be willing to start a new troop of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>and become its Scout Master.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Scout Work is Progressive.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In all of the Scout work the advancement of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>from rank to rank should be encouraged as much as possible. It is essential to keep the interest of the boys aroused, if there is to be continued success in the work from month to month, and the program of new activities and new interests provided by the different Scout ranks has been originated and developed to meet this need of a graduated interest-series. The whole work is progressive and the whole Scouting idea has been so mapped out and developed that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>of twelve or thirteen starting as a Tenderfoot should find new interests to attract and more complex and different things to accomplish as he advances, that will keep him busy throughout his whole period of Scouting days, and build him gradually and surely along efficient lines for the preparedness of his future manhood and citizenship. The Scout Master should endeavor to keep the interest from lagging by carrying out the general programs of Scouting, originate such new work as his geographical environment might suggest or seem to warrant, keep in touch with his fellow Scout Masters in his district or State, and join with them in any sort of inter-troop contest or district work that will lend virile action or arouse more interest, and encourage his boys to keep moving in their work from one class rank to the next, and so attain the goal of all <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>entire preparedness and full efficiency by qualifying as an Eagle Scout.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Scout Advancement.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As indicated by the Scout Class Requirements given in the Handbook pp. 16-18, there are three main divisions of progress. First the Scout attains the rank of Tenderfoot. After one month&#39;s service he may become a Second Class Scout, providing he has shown preparation necessary to pass the standard tests. After that as soon as he is sufficiently prepared in the next rank requirements, he may become a First Class Scout. The way is now open for qualification for merit badges, in which the Scout makes practical application of his general knowledge gained in Scoutcraft practice, and gains a greater efficiency and development along particular pathways of knowledge.</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA53'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Merit Badges.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The examination for these badges should be given by the Court of Honor of the Local Council. This examination must not be given any <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who is not qualified as a FirstClass Scout. After the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>has passed the examination, the Local Council may secure the Merit Badge for him by presenting the facts to the National Council. These badges are intended to stimulate the boy&#39;s interest in the life about him and are given for general knowledge. The wearing of these badges does not signify that a Scout is qualified to make his living by the knowledge gained in securing the award.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In any case where through lack of knowledge or experience, the Court of Honor representative giving the examination is unfamiliar with the Merit Badge Requirements, he should obtain the aid of an expert on the subject whose signature should appear with that of the Court of Honor member on the recommendation sent to National Headquarters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the applicant for the merit badge has appeared before the Court of Honor and passed the examination on the subject as set forth in the official Handbook, the application blank is submitted by the Court of Honor of the Local Council with recommendations to the Court of Honor of the National Council. A monthly meeting of the National Court of Honor is held at National Headquarters when all applications received from various Local Councils throughout the country are considered and finally passed upon or rejected by them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In communities where there are but one or two troops of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>and where a Local Council has not been organized, Scout Masters are advised to organize a Local Committee of representative men, including the superintendent or principal of schools, to pass upon these various qualifications. Application blanks for merit badges properly certified by this Committee will be recognized by the National Court of Honor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The way is also open to attain the higher ranks open to all prepared <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>with badges indicating the steady advance toward a greater and greater efficiency and more complete development. So passing from the first grade as a Life Scout, the possessor of five merit badges, the Scout will through persistence and training become also a Star<span class='gtxt_body'>
Scout, and in the end the Eagle Scout. By this time the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should be reaching maturity both mentally and physically, and having attained the highest Scout rank is quite prepared to cope with all problems of his future.</span></p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA54'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This progressive plan of development should give to the Scout all that is necessary to keep him interested and busy during his five or six years of Scout service. There are certain things which have been planned for the younger boys and certain other attainments for the older <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>and with the large amount of time given to general Scoutcraft practice, there should be plenty to do for every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>before he has attained his rank as an Eagle Scout and has reached the cooperative period of his life in young manhood. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should not be hurried or pushed on from one grade to another, as he will gain best development by slow assimilation of details and gradual development, but on the other hand the Scout Master should guard against lack of action or loss of interest. Stagnation of the onward impulse anywhere along the line is usually indicative of something wrong, either with the methods of the Scout Master, with the appeal of the developing Scout work, or with the general program of procedure of Scouting. Steps should at once be taken in such case to clear up the situation, revive the interest and progress, and invigorate the desires of the boys with the spirit of advancement.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Scout Examinations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All Scout Examinations for passing the different rankrequirements of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America should be given either in person or under the direction or supervision of one or all the members of the Local Court of Honor. In communities .where the Local Council has not yet been formed, the examination should be conducted by a neighboring Scout Master, or by one or two representative citizens who have been instructed in the nature and extent of the work covered. The Tenderfoot examinations are very simple, but from that point the requirements grow more complex and difficult, and it will certainly lend weight and dignity to the importance of the occasion if the examination for the upper Scout ranks and for the qualification of Merit Badges are conducted by as many members of the Court of Honor and experts or with as marked attention as possible.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In some cities <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>are allowed to take examinations in<span class='gtxt_body'>
the various requirement tests as soon as they are ready to pass them. Sometimes preliminary tests are made. In other places the candidate must qualify in all of the tests at the time set for the examination. This latter policy, it would seem, would be productive of best results and better order in systematic Scout work, unless a complex system of records, exact in all details, is made use of. Certain definite dates should be determined upon for examinations. More interest should be aroused thereby, and the number of participants would most likely be increased. In any event such a course should prove of advantage in helping to standardize examinations and Scout records.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Suggested Methods of Marking for Use in InterPatrol Contests.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As inter-patrol competitions are held during the year in the city from which these suggestions come, the examination papers, as above, are marked as follows: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(1) <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>passing with a percentage of from 85 to</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>100 will be awarded an &quot;H,&quot; which means that the Scout has passed with honor, and his patrol will be credited with 25 points.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(2) <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>passing with an average of from 70 to 85</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>per cent- will be given a &quot; C,&quot; which shows creditable work, and his patrol will be awarded 15 points.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(3) <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>passing with a percentage of from 60 to 70</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>will be given a &quot;P,&quot; which means he has been successful and passed the examination. This patrol will be awarded 5 points.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA57'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(4) Any Scout receiving a percentage of between 50</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and 60 will be marked with an &quot;F,&quot; which means that he has failed to meet the standard of requirements. However, he will be allowed to take the next regular examination given by .the Court of Honor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(5) Any Scout failing to receive a percentage of at</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>least 50 will be marked &quot;FF<i>&quot; </i>and his patrol will have to forfeit 10 points. He will not be allowed to take the next examination, but may take anyone succeeding that.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Investiture Ceremony.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>No certain form of investiture of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>in their different ranks has been followed, but the question of simplicity or impressiveness of such ceremony has been left largely to the individual tastes and originality of the Scout Masters. Some prefer to have the ceremony as simple as it may be, while others find best results in incorporating fraternity ceremonies to create interest, give a strong impression, and provide added dignity. As a matter of fact the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>at Scout age is impressed with ceremonial just because he is, and likes to be counted as, one of the gang or troop, and some form of ceremonial certainly lends a greater meaning and stronger feeling in the attainment of any social achievement. It is best however to guard against complexity of such ceremonial lest the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>become wearied with its makebelieve formalism and lose respect for the underlying principles. The first ceremony, too, should be simple and pointed, as for the Tenderfoot, and as the Scout advances in rank new symbolistic ceremonies should be added to the investitures to produce a stronger impression of the achievements&#39; worth and give a greater dignity to the importance of the rank.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the chapter on &quot;Programs for Scout Masters,&quot; which by suggestions carries a troop onward from its first organization to First Class Scout rank, investiture ceremonies are suggested as parts of regular programs. In some cities or districts such ceremonial is sometimes standardized by the Scout Commissioner for the use of all troops in his community, but while the wording and thought varies according to the locality and initiative of the Scout Leader, the general outline of investiture must remain very much the same. One of the best forms in actual use for the Ten<span class='gtxt_body'>derfoot Scout rank is herewith suggested: Form <i>the </i>troop into a horseshoe formation with the Scout Master and his Assistant in the gap. The Tenderfoot with his patrol leader stands just inside of the circle and opposite to the Scout Master. The Assistant Scout Master holds the staff and-hat of the candidate. When ordered by-the Scout Master to come forward.the Patrol Leader brings the Tenderfoot to the center. The Scout Master then asks: &quot;Do you know what your honor is?&quot;</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tenderfoot replies: &quot;Yes, it means that I can be trusted to be truthful and honest&quot; (or words to that effect).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scout Master: &quot;Can I trust you on your honor to do your duty to your God and country and to obey the Scout law? To help other people at all times? To keep yourself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight?&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Tenderfoot then salutes, as do the whole troop while he repeats the Scout Oath: &#8212;&quot; On my honor I will do my best: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(1) To do my duty to God and my country, and obey</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the Scout Law.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(2) To help other people at all times.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(3) To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and morally straight.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master replies: &quot;I trust you will keep these promises. You are now one of the great brotherhood of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts.&quot; </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Assistant Scout Master then puts on his hat and gives him his staff, decorates him with the Tenderfoot badge and greets him with the grip or <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Handshake for the Tenderfoot. In case there is no Assistant Scout Master, the senior patrol leader will have charge of the staff and hat, and the Scout Master decorates him with the badge and greets him with the handshake of the Tenderfoot. The new Scout then faces about and salutes the troop. The troop then present staves, the Scout Master gives the word to the troop &quot;Right by twos, march,&quot; whereupon the new Scout takes his place in his patrol, and the troop shoulder staves and march once around the room or square and then disband on the order and take seats.<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> <i>Editorial Note.</i>&#8212; In -all initiatory or investiture ceremonies, all forms of hazing or &quot; ragging&quot; should be absolutely barred. Among boys, because of immaturity of knowledge and experience, such practices often become brutal, dangerous and criminal.</p>

The laws have been increased from nine to twelve. The Scout Oath has been modified and the Scout Requirements changed to make them more representative of American life. All these changes have been made in order to more effectually help the American <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Reasons for Changes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The attitude of the Scout authorities in making the changes has been that of open mindedness. Suggestions from all over the country were asked for, received and given careful attention, the one thing in mind being to get the Scout Oath, Scout Law and Scout Requirements as simple as possible for the normal <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>Much consideration was given to the suggested substitute for the term Scout Oath. It was agreed that the word promise was not strong enough to grasp the imagination of the boys; that the word pledge has been given a distinct temperance content, and that the word vow had too much of a religious significance. Therefore, the word oath was kept after due deliberation, it being thoroughly understood that the Scout Oath was not in any way like the oath taken in a formal court of law, but that it was more on the order of the knightly oath of the Middle Ages, where the knight pledged his w&#187;rd of honor to reverence his king as his conscience, and his conscience as his king. It is indeed a pledge of fidelity by knights of a newer era for the building of a better and more social chivalry.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Third Section of the Scout Oath.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It will be noticed that the Scout Oath has undergone considerable change. The third section of the Scout Oath has been incorporated with the first section of the new, and a third section has been added, namely: &quot;To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.&quot; It is desired by this latter section of the Oath to keep before the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>the fact that it is his business to keep himself strong, to get for himself an education for life, and at the same time to keep himself clean in his resolutions, to himself, and to others, and to his Creator. The desire underlying the change was to sum up all the cardinal things to be brought to the boys&#39; attention in the Scout Oath.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Aim of the Scout Law. The Scout Law is intended to inculcate those ideas which should underlie the life of each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The aim is to get the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to understand the value of his honor, to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent. Laws 10, 1 1 and 12 have been added to the original number because it was thought that these things had been touched on in the Scout Oath but had been omitted in the Scout Law. Besides this, several additions and emendations have been made to the original nine, and General Baden-Powell, the author of the original law, has commended the changes and additions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Spirit of the Scout Law.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It will not be to the interests of the Scout Master to teach the Scout Oath and Law to the Scout without living up to the spirit of these himself. To-day we teach more by example than by precept, and the life of the Scout Master will be the most potent teaching that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>can receive. In every activity the Scout Master should impress upon the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>that it is his business to manifest the -spirit of the law and that he should not allow himself to be side-tracked from doing his duty as set forth in the Scout Law.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Laxity Versus Discipline and the Scout Law.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master should not be anxious to discipline the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>There will be many little lapses on the part of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>because the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is not mature and is not possessed of a developed mind. In fact the Scout Master will make some of these lapses himself if he is not careful. The Scout<span class='gtxt_body'>
Master should not be petty in his discipline but should stand on the high plane of honor in everything. On the other hand he should be careful not to be lax, and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout should understand that when he has said a thing, he means it. Liberal and cautious in his judgment, but firm in his attitude when once his judgment has been made, should be the rule of the Scout Master in matters of discipline, if he has not come to the point where he can trust the boys to make their own laws and judge their own offenses. A form of punishment which has worked out well in other boys&#39; organizations has been to delay the examination of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>for advanced work because of his offense to a later time, thus depriving the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>of the pleasure he had anticipated. Law 3 and the Home.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Law 3 has been broadened so that it covers the home. One of the essential things that the Scout Master should do is to cooperate with the home in matters of parental authority and obedience. The requirement that he shall share the home duties is intended to give the Scout the intimate touch and contact with those of the home circle which he ought to have.<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Law 10 and Courage.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Law 1o seeks to encourage the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to be the possessor of moral courage, to face danger without fear and to stand up for the right in spite of the coaxings of his friends or the jeers of his enemies; and, when he has been defeated, never to feel broken, but to be ready again for another onslaught and a possible victory. This law recognizes that it is right to fight if there is necessity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Law <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Ii </span>and Cleanliness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Law 1 1 recognizes the idea of environment and urges the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to choose his companions rightly, knowing that the life of his companions very largely molds the life of the growing <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>Law n considers cleanliness and deals with the opposition to tobacco, cigarette smoking, liquor and profanity, but covers a great deal more in its scope. Law 12 and Reverence.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Law 12 directs the attention of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to the idea of reverence. It holds his religious duties as an ideal worthy</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of being worked for, and urges upon him the duty and responsibility of respecting the convictions of every other man in the matters of tradition, custom and religion. Should he think he has more light on these matters than the man next him, he should be the more generous and liberal because of that fact.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Spread of the Scouting Idea. The idea of Scouting is no longer a national provincial thing. Like the sun, it has penetrated to all the corners of the earth and now it holds twenty-six countries, including the English Colonies, in the bonds of its brotherhood. Starting with the ideas of a few Americans, as they have been worked out in various American <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>organizations, they have been adopted and organized by Lieutenant General Sir Robert Baden-Powell, and have gone forth from him to circle the globe and draw the boys of the world into the great brotherhood of boyhood and peace. Other <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>organizations have had a national scope,&#8212; the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Movement is international and world wide in its influence.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>General Characteristics of the Adolescent Age.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The interests of the adolescent <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>are general and not specialized between the twelfth and eighteenth year. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>gets his impressions of the community objectively, in addition to increasing his knowledge of the external world through his acquaintanceship with its phenomena. The Universe and the Community are extensive and many sided. The step also between twelve and eighteen years is short. The boy&#39;s contact with these, then, must be rapid and general. The Scouting activities afford such contact.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scouting as an Auxiliary to the Home, School and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Church.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are three institutions that should mold the life of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy,</span>&#8212; the Home, School and Church. Nothing should interfere with functions of these, and the place of any auxiliary organization should be supplementary in its nature and educational in character. The Scout Idea takes the nonsupervised, leisure time of boys and fills it with recreation, &#8212; educational activity. It teaches him facts about nature and citizenship and how to get the most out of life. It leaves parental and School and Church ties stronger because of non-interference. It is primarily educational, leading<span class='gtxt_body'>
the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>by degrees to a rounded symmetrical development. Scouting Provides Occupation for the Leisure Hours. The preventative work of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America cannot be tabulated in statistical form but beyond question it is its largest achievement. You can sum up the whole philosophy of reaching and holding boys for all that is noble and right in one word,&#8212; preoccupation. The fathers and mothers do not fear for their boys when they are busy in school, at the factory or in the office. The time to be alarmed in their behalf is in connection with the un-accounted-for evenings, the half-holidays, the time between the closing of school and supper. To these hours we may trace the formation of most of the life habits which mean the undoing of the best of our boys. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America in providing helpful and character-building occupation for these hours is therefore rendering a service of inestimable importance.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Call of Service and Citizenship.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The call of the Community is service. This constitutes Patriotism to State and Country. The cry of the adolescent <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is Service. This means that citizenship, in its formation, begins with the twelve-year-old <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The Scout Idea recognizes the voice of Adolescence, and in this, his thought and life challenges the developing <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to seek new expression in a &quot; Good turn done daily &quot; to someone.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Appeal of Scouting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In brief Scouting appeals to boys because it affords them activities suited to their years in a complete symmetrical way. These activities do not interfere with the home, school or church, are primarily educational, and urge the Service Spirit in adolescent boyhood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scouting means a great deal more than merely outdoor activity. It touches all the interests of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life and besides giving an occupation in woodlore activities such as being able to find a direction in the woods without a compass, to discover the latitude by the stars, to know the birds, fish, reptiles, insects, butterflies, rocks, pebbles, flowers, ferns, grasses, fungi, trees and wild animals, gives him practical instruction in how to camp out, to canoe, to sail a boat, to take care of his health, to appreciate the spirit of the past with its gentle manners and rich achievements, to render<span class='gtxt_body'>
first aid in case of fire and water accidents, to play games with the spirit of fair play, and to compete in athletic contests with a sterling regard for his own and his competitor&#39;s honor, and finally how to achieve citizenship &#8212; to know the things that enter into the making of a citizen, to understand how to be a citizen &#8212; <i>to know, to be, and to do. </i></span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Qualifications of the Scout Master.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The qualifications of a good Scout Master may be divided into three classes; fundamental, essential and secondary. The fundamental qualities which the Scout Master must have to make him an acceptable worker with boys are &quot;<i>horse sense&quot; </i>and the <i>judicial capacity. </i>No man can expect to lead boys for any great length of time who fails to have a keen appreciation of the perspective of things. There is an everlasting fitness which the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>looks for in the man and nothing steals the boy&#39;s confidence from his leader more than the lack of ability on the part of the man to size up things in a common-sense manner and to deal with them without fuss or feathers. He must also avoid anything that looks like favoritism or partiality. He is given the oversight of twenty-four boys for a definite reason. One <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>would often gain his point with his Scout Master were it not for the presence of the other twentythree. The Scout Master must not give way to the boy&#39;s desire against the boy&#39;s good, and must never become unduly emotional in dealing with his <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>In other words he must be judicial in his attitude as he works with the boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Given these fundamental characters of common sense and judicial capacity, he must have the three essential qualifications of every leader of boys. He must be possessed of a <i>good character </i>because the movement in which he works is a moral movement and aims to build up character as well as citizenship. He must also have the <i>ability to gain the respect of boys. </i>No weak, vacillating, inert, back-boneless creature may ever aspire to the leadership of a group of boys. There must be in him that quality which will appeal to the boy&#39;s respect and which will compel them to follow him. The Scout Master must also, as an essential qualification, have <i>executive ability for leadership. </i>He does not need to be an expert in Scoutcraft but he must have a deep interest in boys, be genuine in his own life, and have the ability to lead and command the boys&#39; respect and obedience. The. good Scout Master because of his executive<span class='gtxt_body'>
ability will discover experts for the various activities such as woodcraft, signalling, camping, canoeing, hiking, tracking, first aid, and life saving. He will also be able to find men who will gladly give the boys interesting talks on the principles of chivalry and citizenship.</span></p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA65'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To be a really successful leader, a Scout Master must also have four secondary characteristics. He must not be like a ship without a rudder at sea, and no matter what he does with his boys, he <i>must always have a definite aim in mind. </i>He ought to know what he is driving at, what he is aiming for. Not only this but he should <i>have a well-defined plan, </i>having clearly in mind the stages through which he will bring to pass his aim. In doing this he must have a great stock of patience and be <i>possessed of a mighty desire to invest himself and his time. </i>No Scout Master can hope to do very lasting work with any group of boys who is sparing of himself or grudges his own leisure time to the work. Above all the Scout Master must remember that he is not dealing with a physical <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>only, but that <i>the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>boy </i></span><i>is physical, mental, moral and social in his make-up. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master who has these fundamental, essential and secondary qualifications stands a fair chance of <span class="gstxt_hlt">doing </span>the most acceptable kind of work with a troop of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Need of Study. To keep properly in advance of the boys in his troop, the Scout Master will need to be a student. He cannot hope in these days of numerous books to lead his boys in the discovery of new things if he is not determined to do a good deal of reading. A Scout Master, where possible, should attend a course of lectures concerning Scouting to get a knowledge and insight into the subjects which are covered by the movement. He should do a great deal of reading along the lines of Scouting besides attending lectures on outdoor activities.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Scout Master and the Father.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master should by no means try to become a father to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The responsibility and duties of parents must not for one moment devolve upon him. The following editorial from a New York evening newspaper puts this idea in a very clear manner and it should be given careful consideration by every Scout Master.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;It takes time to point a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>right. The great merchant</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>can touch a desk bell to give orders for a steamship or a draft of a million dollars. But the merchant&#39;s young son, age fourteen, cannot be touched off in that way. The lad has just begun to move out among other boys. They do a world of talking, these young chaps. The father must watch that talk, and he can, if he will take the time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Influence.of the Father.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The older man has every advantage for he is looked up to and beloved. It is not so much the &#39;don&#39;ts&#39; as the . do&#39;s&#39; that constitute his power. He can inspire with high resolve. He can narrate his own victories over sore trials and fiery tests of his integrity. He can draw the sting of poisonous suggestions, moral disheartenings and malice which his child has been cherishing in his young heart. But this means time, and time may be money. Yet no money can buy the sort of instruction, nor put a price on it. The coin is struck in the soul. It is the costliest barter, the very exchange of the soul.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Boys who go right have invariably had a world of time spent on them in this way. Boys go wrong because the father would not take the time from the market. In after years the same parent will take vastly more time to try, in tears of sorrow, to straighten out that <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy.&quot; </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Scout Master and the Home.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master can do his best work when working in conjunction with the home. It is a good plan to visit the father and mother of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>before the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is enrolled in the patrol, explaining to them just what Scouting means and what is to be gained by it. It is also a pretty good thing to occasionally drop in to see the father and mother of.the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>telling them how the Scout is getting along, giving them a hint here and there how to apply the Scout Law and Oath in the home. The meetings of the troop and patrol should never be secret in that parents and friends are debarred from them. An invitation extended to the parents through the bov himself to attend a meeting of the patrol or troop will also afford a valuable means of contact with the home and parents.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Scout Master and the School.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master must keep in mind that it is his business to work in cooperation with all of the forces that are</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>trying to help the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to live rightly in his community. The work of the Public School must continue to go on without a break if the ideals of our American citizenship are to be maintained, and it is the business of the Scout Master to give his support, encouragement and cooperation for the carrying out of the idea for which the school stands. The public school seeks to give the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>the necessary education towards his earning a livelihood, and the business of Scouting is to supplement this training by recreational education in the form of outdoor life, scout activities and training in courtesy and citizenship. The Scout Master then is doing his best work when he so plans his Scouting that it will fit into the school or employed life of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Scout Master and Religion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>No Scout Master should think for one moment that the moral life of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>depends entirely on him. The religious life of the community was in existence long beforeScouting was ever thought of. The Scout Master by his own life should be an example to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and he should never under any circumstances seek to supplant the influence of the church, Sunday school or religious organization in the mind of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Cooperation. Recognizing the fact that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is physical, social, mental and moral, he should bend every effort to work with all of the organizations and institutions in the community for the boy&#39;s best development. He should also seek the sympathy, cooperation and approval of the community&#39;s religious teachers.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Scouting is Recreational.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master should always keep in mind the fact that Scouting is recreational education. It is not the education of the schoolroom and should never be formal. An informal group of boys gathered around a Scout Master on a plot of grass, in a clump of trees, by the side of a brook, or lying lazily before a warmth-giving log fire affords a setting in which a Scout Master can give the best instruction to the boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Worth of the Story.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The method employed should be the story-method instead of academic instruction. It is much easier to impress upon<span class='gtxt_body'>
the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-mind </span>the necessity of fitness and endurance and the habits that make these by telling a story of a football game that was won by the physical prowess of some player, than it is to tell him of the principles which should enter into his life to make him strong. The telling of the story will leave a vivid impression upon the mind of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>and the impression will stay with him when the incident and the lesson that was to be taught are forgotten. To be a successful teacher of life&#39;s lessons, to make a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>a strong and a good citizen, depends very largely upon the way in which the information is imparted. The great speakers to boys always use the story-telling method of omitting a moral at the conclusion by wrapping the lesson and moral within the story itself. A well-told story often has more influence through suggestion than any amount of direct advice.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Spirit of Scouting and the Spirit of the Scout Master.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Spirit of the Scout Master must be the spirit of Scouting itself. There is hardly any use of a Scout Master trying to teach the principles of the Scout Oath and Scout Law, if he is not living them himself. The spirit of the Scout Oath and Law must permeate his own life before he can hope to make an impression on the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is a hater of shams, and once he sees through a man who is trying to teath him something that he himself is not, nothing on earth can make the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>do other than despise the man. This means that a Scout Master must always be on his mettle, that he will have to keep himself &quot; physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight&quot; if he is to lead his boys; and that he will have to &quot; help other people at all times,&quot; as well as displaying in his own life the principles that underlie chivalry. It means that he will have to do always his &quot; duty to God and his country,&quot; and &quot;to obey the Scout Law.&quot; It further means that he himself will have to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent, and if the Scout Master does his best to carry out these principles in his own life, as a great teacher of old once said, others shall see him and shall follow. There then will be no difficulty with Scout Masters handling their boys and the Scout Master and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will develop together, and together find success in Scouting.</p>

<a class='page'  id='PA69'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Principles of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy-Work. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Several well-defined and exceedingly clear principles of action underlie the successful handling of groups of boys: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>First, there must be a clear plan well thought out, progressive in its stages with an aim for each stage. In other words no man need try to work with a group of boys unless he knows what he wants to do, not only in outline but in detail. He must have these details in mind and so well worked out in his thought, knowing exactly what comes next and just what is to be added to that which he has already accomplished, as to be master of the situation at all times and to be the recognized leader. Not only this, but the boys must feel that he really knows what he is driving at in everything that he attempts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Secondly, before the leader of a group of boys tries to do anything with the group, if he is to be successful, it is necessary for him to make a frank outlined statement of his plan. That is to say, he should tell the boys what the game is and how it is to be played, getting their approval, and agreement to get in on the deal. He can explain this to all of the boys at one time or singly to each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>There is no question but that he will succeed best if he should go over the matter first with each individual <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>personally, finding out the individual impressions, and also having discussion before the group or patrol unit. This being done the boys know the plan, the leader knows what he is working towards, and the leader and the boys are partners in the work. In this way the right idea of Scouting will be given to the boys and they will understand just what it means. Too often groups of boys are brought together and the aim is so hazy in the leader&#39;s mind that all the boys can possibly see in the scheme is a &quot; good time.&quot; No Scout Master who fails to hold up before the boys a clear, comprehensive statement of Scouting that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>can understand, can ever hope to see his boys do anything else but look for fun and mischief in everything they do. Such a patrol or troop cannot last very long because the Scout Master will very soon be asking himself if the thing that he is attempting is worth the trouble to which he is going.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Application of Self-Government.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Thirdly, the best way to have boys accomplish things is to allow them to do the things. Many a leader of boys<span class='gtxt_body'>
thinks out a plan, gives it to a group of boys and then thinks that the boys are themselves doing it, whereas he is only trying to use the boys as his instrument. The most effectual way of getting boys to do things themselves is to let them do as much as they can and will do under adequate supervision. Lead by suggestion, so that unconsciously the boys follow your advice and dictation, giving them the benefit of their decisions and impulses. Pure self-government in which the boys are entirely the dictators of their policies and activities can not be thought of, because such a course is so generally fatal to successful development. But selfgovernment fostered and dealt with through suggestion by the adult mind is just what is needed, and should always be encouraged.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Scout Master as a Real Leader.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Fourth, in letting the boys run their own affairs in this way the Scout Master must become a real leader. A real leader never stalks in front, nor gives orders openly. The generals of to-day fight their battles and win them twentyfive miles in the rear of the firing line. So it is with the Scout Master. He must be the power behind the throne, rather than the throne itself. He must be as a conscience &#8212; to hold the boys back just a little when they go too fast and to push just a little when they are going too slow. The Scout Master must recognize himself to be the impetus, not the goal. The solution of each problem that comes before a patrol or troop should not only be considered by the whole group, but should be solved by the boys whenever such action will not interfere with the best interests of the group and the movement. The important thing for the Scout Master to remember in these matters is that his fundamental objective is good citizenship and that the method of practical American citizenship is the majority rule. But this <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>majority rule should, of course, be tempered by governing leadership. Thus the Scout Master will not do anything that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>can do himself, and he will be continually placing responsibility on the lad. Responsibility is the great maker of men.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Differences, &quot;Scraps&quot; and Misunderstandings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fifth, there will be of course noticeable differences among the boys of the patrol and troop. The most serious differences arise even among men. The boys will &quot;scrap&quot; at<span class='gtxt_body'>
times, and there will sometimes be a tension and rigidity about their discussions that will approach the breaking point. Through it all it will be difficult for the Scout Master to keep himself patiently aloof and allow the thing to work out its own way. Sometimes an appeal will be made to him to settle the dispute, and he will be tempted to do so, but often such action will imperil the object for which he is working. It is best to allow the boys to discuss, and try out all of their logic before he begins to make suggestions and, if he can get the boys to settle the matter themselves, it is to his interest to do so. If a deadlock threatens to exist, then by wise council and judicious suggestions he may be able to lead the boys out of a quandary in such a way that it will look as if the boys had gotten out of the difficulty themselves. This will certainly add strength to their organization and they will settle their own quarrels with peace and dignity. Sometimes the break between the boys will be so bitter as to cause the formation of intensely hostile factions, and then the best thing the Scout Master can do is not to try any new patching or drawing together of the opposing forces. There is no use trying to make boys who are bitterly antagonistic, agreeable to each other. Let them make new alignments if necessary and in combinations of their own choosing, even if the result should be the formation of new patrols.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Rules and Infringements of Rules.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sixth, the boys should make their own rules and provide for the infringement of minor rules, insofar as such action will not be a harm or a hindrance. <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>punishments meted out by boys to boys sounds well enough in theory but does not prove efficient in practice, and should by all means be discouraged or forbidden. The danger of an excessive tendency toward unreasonable action or decisions by the boys is too great. But wherever possible the boys should have a hand in the making of the laws which govern them. Responsibility should be the key-note; and the awakening of such a feeling in the boys should be the goal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Adolescent Change.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Idea fits into the life of the adolescent <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>Until about the age of twelve the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is distinctly individualistic and selfish. At about twelve years of age, his whole nature begins to change because of the change in his</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA72'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>bodily functions. This change occurs anywhere from the twelfth to the sixteenth year and is really determined by his physical development rather than by his chronological age. The change of bodily functions give him a new outlook upon life. He begins to see and understand that he is a part of the community in which he is living and begins to understand that the community life is made possible by a disposition on the part of his neighbors to help each other. He also begins to understand the institutional life about him and the family and sex tie on which it is based. He sees also the need of the school, the church and other public institutions. He also begins to appreciate the wider range of things. Nature has greater appeal to him now than ever. The woods and streams and outdoor life get a new significance, and the question of livelihood whether rural and agricultural, or in the line of the various industries, takes a firm hold upon his imagination, and gives him a life compelling purpose. He begins to feel the mating call and at its first impression is attracted to the other sex, with the result that by and by he also becomes a husband and father and a full-fledged citizen among his fellows. Up to the age of adolescence however, none of these emotions stir the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and since the aim of scouting is manhood and citizenship, the scouting activities ought not to be given to boys who have not reached adolescence or the beginning of the change into manhood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Characteristics of the Early Adolescent Age.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The early adolescent age from twelve to fifteen years is characterized by a rapid and uneven growth during which vitality and energy alternate with languorousness, and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is awkward and lazy, with bones greatly outgrowing muscle. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>also begins to take a new interest in sex and sex relations, his features and voice change, and the inherited tendencies begin to assert themselves. His health is usually at its best, and during his active moments he is boisterous and vigorously energetic. He is selfish but shows signs of altruism; his regard for law increases; the spirit of gang leadership begins to show itself; his longing for friendship is noticeable; his sense of secretiveness is apparent; and his self-assertiveness first begins to be manifested. He is creative in imagination, shows marvelous powers of inference, becomes strongly intellectual, begins to manifest analytic reasoning, imitates the ideal, is uncertain in making deci<span class='gtxt_body'>sions, is influenced by suggestions, and possesses generally a strong but not a logical memory. He develops natural religious notions, has strong impulses to do big things, has definite convictions as to his belief in God and Heaven and the understanding of traditional religious terms, shows a noticeable lack of interest in the forms of nature, but a keen appreciation of the spiritual, and is passing through a period when great resolves are most often made.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Characteristics of Later Adolescence. During the period of later adolescence from fifteen to eighteen years of age, the body nearly attains its maximum growth, the mind begins to show its dominance over the body, and all the bodily impulses grow stronger and more vigorous. Altruism steadily increases; the consciousness of society grows; an appreciation of individual worth and thought develops; the call of sex and the love emotion grows in strength; sentiment is inclined to become strong; boundless enthusiasm manifests itself; and organization and cooperation begin to appeal and be appreciated more and more. There is a growth in logic, a development of skepticism, independent thought, alertness in thinking, and quickness of receptive powers. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>at this, age is in the period of highest resolves and greatest endeavor, is apt to show religious skepticism, and reason often takes the place of his faith.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Classes of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy-Types. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In talking about boys either in the aggregate or as individuals it is best to consider them as representative of certain definite types. Boylife can be more easily considered in this way by making special study of particular <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>types. In the first place there are the psychological types,&#8212; the choleric, the sanguine, the phlegmatic, and the hybrid. There are also the types of real life with which we are most familiar,&#8212; the masterful, the weak, the mischievous, the backward, the shy, the bully, the joker, the &quot; smartie,&quot; the echo or shadow, the quiet or reticent, the girl struck, the self-conscious, the unconscious, and the forgetful. Lastly, we should also consider the different types of the unfortunate boys, including the deficient, the delinquent, the criminal, the dependent, the neglected, the foreign born, the wage-earner, the poverty-stricken, boys of very wealthy parents, over-ambitious boys who have over-ambitious par<span class='gtxt_body'>ents, and street boys, who are either loafers or engaged in street trades, or are compelled to use the street as a playground.</span></p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA74'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Choleric <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span>The choleric fellow who is always off at &quot;halfcock,&quot; running his head into danger whenever he can, and who is extremely hectic in his make up, is always a problem. He needs a strong hand. Sometimes, he will need even physical repression, but he always demands great care and patience. The Scout Master should deal with each class of boys largely by suggestion, but in the case of the choleric fellow he will often need to use orders and demonstrate that he himself is in the saddle.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Sanguine <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The sanguine fellow is the normal <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who, having a good digestion, a good home and no cause for worry, sees things as they are and is apt to take them as they come. He will be the easiest kind of a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to get along with, and the only thing that the Scout Master will have to do may be to provide for stimulation of his interest and ambition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Phlegmatic Type.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The phlegmatic chap requires patience more than anything else; generally slow of body he is usually slow of speech and thought. If the Scout Master is not careful he will be apt to call him &quot; dense,&quot; and speak to him sharply and at times rather crossly. He cannot do this if he expects to win the fellow. Temperamentally, nature has made him what he is and the Scout Master will have to work harder, make things more concrete that he wants to teach, and hold his impatience in check. Phlegmatic though he is, he will prove solid in everything he does, and he will be either a rock of strength or of weakness to the Scout Master. If he likes the Scout Master nothing will shake his love, but if he has a dislike for him, then the Scout Master is at the end of his endeavor as far as he is concerned.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Hybrid <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>is a Problem.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The hybrid <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>always furnishes a guessing contest.&#8212; impulsive to-day, he has to be repressed; phlegmatic to-morrow, he has to be stimulated; and he may be sanguine the next day. There never was a pleasanter <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to work with, but like the chameleon you are never sure of his color.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>&quot;Breath of balm and snow, <br/> June and March together, <br/>  In an hour or so.&quot; <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Just because he is so changeable the Scout Master should show him his best thought and work. It is just such fellows who are inclined to be shiftless and who are generally crowded out in the fight for life. Somewhere in the boy&#39;s nature, if the Scout Master is patient, he will find the rock bottom upon which to build manhood and citizenship. Such achievement, however, comes only by great patience and hard work.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Masterful <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>and the Weak <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The masterful and weak boys represent the antipodes of boyhood. The masterful <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will see things quickly, will be the leader of his gang, will dominate his patrol, and will run the troop unless the Scout Master is on his job. The weak <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will follow anywhere, be the cause good or bad, and become either a devil or a saint. The masterful <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>may be handled by appealing to his sense of leadership. Responsibility should be placed upon him. The Scout Master should make him feel that he is leaning heavily on him. The weak <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>on the other hand should be tied up to some steady phlegmatic fellow, the phlegmatic fellow being given the vision of how he can be an older brother to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>not as strong as himself. The result will be that the weak <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will catch some of. the spirit of the phlegmatic chap, and gradually get some depth for himself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Mischievous <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Of all the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>types, the mischievous <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>furnishes the real pleasure for the worker with boys. The fellow whose eyes can twinkle and who will play a practical trick on the friend he most respects, is always a delight. It is he that keeps the crowd in good humor, who is generally deepest and most abiding in his affection, and who at the drop of the hat would fight to the last ditch for his friend. To handle him rightly does not require a six foot rod, or a half inch rule. But the Scout Master must keep him so busy doing the things that he likes that he will have no dull moments in which to vent his inborn sense of humor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Backward <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The backward <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will need to be led out of himself. Give him things to do which will make him forget himself<span class='gtxt_body'>
and by careful utilization of his time, gradually he will develop into a normal <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></span></p>

<a class='page'  id='PA76'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Shy <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The shy <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>has merely become shy because of lack of association. Usually he has been brought up with his mother and sisters and merely lacks the touch of a man and a man&#39;s viewpoint. After he comes in contact with other boys, this will wear away. The problem of the Scout Master is to get the other boys in his troop to pilot the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>into the deeper waters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Smartie&quot; and Joker Types.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The &quot;smartie&quot; and the joker types are thorns in the flesh. Just as thorns when pressed in too deeply require a surgical operation to remove them, so it may be necessary for the Scout Master to &quot; sit on&quot; both the &quot; smartie&quot; and the joker. If the other boys of the troop make up their minds to unite in the task, both the &quot;smartie&quot; and joker will become normal boys in less than one season&#39;s activities, and the Scout Master will show his generalship to be of the real sort by enlisting the other boys to do the job.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Echo or Shadow Type.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The echo or shadow type is a serious problem. He it is who generally hinders the good things in life and helps the bad. He can swear by the ward boss in party politics, or he can prove himself an obstacle in the way of civic and national righteousness. The Scout Master&#39;s task in his case is to somehow or other strike the cord of independence, teach him to do things by himself, think for himself and stand on his own feet. Along the coasts of the North Sea, they teach boys to swim by throwing them out beyond their depth. It may be necessary to awaken manhood and independence in the echo by swamping him when he is alone.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Bully.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The bully will be the worst type for the Scout Master until the right <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>comes along; there is no use in the Scout Master worrying himself until he does, because of the bully&#39;s bluster and bluff. Usually the normal <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will accept him at his face value, and it is only when a lad with self-assertion comes along that the sparks will fly. Then the bully will have to back down or take his medicine. A fight between boys is usually not a good thing, but when it</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA77'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>comes to putting the bully in his place it is one&#171;of the greatest institutions that the savage man has invented. Once a bully has lost his place, he may bluster, but his bluff is over.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Quiet or Reticent <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The quiet and reticent fellow is like the mighty sweeping river. He has depths which have been unsounded, and his life has promise of great possibilities. Just the opposite of the bully, he never blusters but thinks out everything as it comes to him. Every impression is stored away and out of the countless impressions which are ma*de upon him, ithere emerges a man of real and wide interests. The task of the Scout Master in his case will be to discover his interests and help him to discover himself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Girl-Struck <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The girl struck fellow somewhat discourages the worker with boys, and yet it is natural that the boys should look with favorable eyes upon the girl, just as the robin hears and answers to the call of his mate. Let no Scout Master or any worker with boys of any organization that has ever been founded, dream for one moment that either he or his institutions can ever block out the lure of the girl. The girl struck <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will have numerous cases of puppy love, and it will be the task of the Scout Master to lead the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>into the kind of social relations that will enable him to be a real value to those of the opposite sex whom he may meet. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will prove a much better husband and father because of his experience.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Self-Conscious and the Unconscious <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The self-conscious and the unconscious boys are merely victims of their surroundings. The self-conscious fellow has no confidence in himself. He is continuously measuring himself by others and is possibly the victim of parental teaching. The constant injunction to act like &quot;Little Willie&quot; next door may have gotten on the boy&#39;s nerves and if the lad has a chance without undue embarrassment he will soon reach the normal stage, and be always a little more courteous and respectful and thoughtful than the fellow without this experience. The unconscious fellow on the other hand will plug along doing all sorts of absurd things, because of his lack of knowledge of the fitness of things. He is generally the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who grows up without any sense of<span class='gtxt_body'>
consistency #nd who has had very much his own way of doing things. He will need to be helped to adjust himself to his environment and to the way that other fellows live. He also will develop as a good man if the Scout Master is a good worker.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Forgetful <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The same may be said about the forgetful <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and in fact about all boys. The forgetful <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>has merely not been interested enough to give his attention to the things that the Scout Master wants him to do. Once a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>has his interest aroused, the Scout Master will have no need of complaint of forgetfulness or of any lack of interest in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Unfortunate Boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The types which have been discussed will generally work out all right and find their places in the various social strata in the community in which they live. The unfortunate boys, however, are handicapped tremendously by their environment and surroundings, and it will often become a part of the Scout Master&#39;s work to help secure a change in these environments. Boys of very wealthy parents and boys from homes of poverty are usually sinned against by their parents. The parents of both are either so busy making money and spending it in the social whirl, or so pushed by the pangs of hunger and the fight for life, that the children who are brought into the world are left either very much to themselves or to underlings who have very little interest in the boy&#39;s welfare. It is these neglected boys that oftenest produce our great criminals. Every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>of this type somehow or other is tied together. The neglected <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>generally becomes the delinquent and the delinquent <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>the criminal, so that what might be said about one, <span class="gstxt_hlt">might </span>be also said about all. This class constitutes our national deficit when we come to consider our assets in manhood and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout Movement, and the Scout Masters can do a tremendous thing here by helping to form the undeveloped wills of these unfortunate fellows.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Deficient and the Dependent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The deficient <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and the dependent are really out of the scope of the Scout Master. The dependent class will have to be taken care of by the charitable institutions of the State, and the deficient <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>because of his lack of mental development will always be a ward of the community.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Wage-Earner and the Over-Ambitious Boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The wage-earning boys and the boys of over-ambitious parents or those who are over-ambitious themselves need all the help and sympathy that they can get from a Scout Master. The father who is pushing his <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>because of his own ambition will very often need to be talked to by the Scout Master or his friends, and given an understanding of the crime he is committing against his own child. The over-ambitious fellow who is pushing everything aside for a definite thing in life, will often have to be talked to in the plainest language by the Scout Master to get him to see his other responsibilities and duties in life. The wage-earning <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who works from early in the morning until late at night .to keep bread in his mouth and breath in his body, will compel the Scout Master, if he is really thoughtful, to give up some of the things which he has already held dearest and possibly lead his wage-earning <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>into Scouting activities, even on the half holidays which he would naturally spend in the circle of his own family.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Street, Foreign-Born and Negro Boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The street, foreign-born and negro boys will furnish very much the same kind of problem; because of a general rule, they may be all grouped under the wage-earning class. Some may be more shiftless than others and may need more attention while others may be merely awaiting the touch of sympathy and the helping hand to make strong men out of them. A goodly percentage of our greatest Americans have been foreign born boys, and if there is any class that the Scout Master should be more patient with than others, it is the immigrant and the son of the immigrant. Economic and social conditions will naturally determine the place of the negro <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the Scout movement, and it is best to leave this problem to the local councils and the Scout Masters who are directly facing the situation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Grouping Standards. The Scout Master will find it greatly to his advantage to group his boys according to some standard. Unfortunately all standards, so far, are more or less artificial, but approximate success may be secured by using the experience of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>workers in various parts of the country. The standard which is most generally used is that of age. It is also the most unsatisfactory. Boys mature physically rather<span class='gtxt_body'>
than chronologically. This makes the age standard a poor guess, because a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>may be physically fourteen when he is chronologically eleven, and vice versa. If the age standard be used, it would be preferable to group all the boys of twelve years together, then the thirteen-year old boys in another group, and the same with the fourteen, the fifteen, the sixteen, and the seventeen-year old boys. This would be rather hard to do in small places, although perfectly feasible in a larger town or city. Because of its impossibility as far as the rural districts are concerned, it might be well to divide the years from twelve to eighteen into three standards,&#8212; twelve to fourteen, fourteen to sixteen, and sixteen to eighteen. The age grouping, however, will never be reliable in achieving results.</span></p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA80'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The height and weight standard is more scientifically correct than the age standard, although it has not been tested out enough to warrant any authoritative declaration in its. favor. If this method is used for grouping, the standards for athletic competition among the boys might be used, that is, all the boys of ninety pounds and under might be put together, the same being true for those under one hundred and ten, one hundred and twenty-five, and one hundred and forty pounds. If height is used, boys of fiftysix and a half inches in height and classifying under ninety pounds in weight, might be grouped together. Also boys of sixty-three inches in height and coming within the one hundred and ten pound weight. This standard will doubtless become the real basis of all groupings in the future, but as yet it needs more demonstration in order that the various classifications may be made accurately.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A simple and rather <span class="gstxt_hlt">satisfactory </span>way of grouping is by the school <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>or wage-earning <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>standard. If the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>happens to be in the grammar school, he may be grouped with boys of his own educational advancement; so with the boys who are in the secondary or high schools, and the same may be said of working boys who are forced to earn their own livelihood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Possibly the best and most satisfactory way of grouping boys is by their interest. Some boys will be mutually interested in collecting stamps, riding a bicycle, forming a mounted patrol, working with wireless, in music and or&#39;chestra work, etc., and boys grouped according to such<span class='gtxt_body'>
kindred interests as they manifest has proven most satisfactory in general boys&#39; work.<span class="gstxt_sup">2</span></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Problems of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy-Handling </span>Simplified by Natural</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Standard Grouping. Grouping the boys according to natural standards makes the problem of handling them much simpler. Boys between twelve and fourteen are in the age of authority, and the word of the Scout Master will settle most difficulties that arise. Boys between fourteen and sixteen are in the age of experience and an opportunity must be given the boys to check up what they are told by what they are experiencing. Between twelve and fourteen, authority may be rigid. Between fourteen and sixteen, it must be giving way to reason. Authority will still continue to settle the boys&#39; disputes but it will be the authority that gives reasons fqr its action. Boys between the ages of sixteen and eighteen years can only be handled on the basis of cooperation. They have passed from the stage of blindly following what they are told. They have experience enough to know that they are able to do things themselves, and they have discovered enough things to give them a basis of doing things on their own account. The way to handle boys rightly in this group will be by tactful suggestion and cooperation on the part of a Scout Master.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>Scouting is More a System of Action Than of <br/>                 Words. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scouting is not just a lot of lectures or talks to a group of boys; the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>does not want to have Scouting talked into him,&#8212; he wants to scout. In early adolescence the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is all movement and it is a punishment for him to sit very long to hear any kind of talk. The blood is being pumped at a much faster rate through his veins in early adolescence than at any other time, and this increased vitality demands increased movement in exercise. Not only should a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>not be compelled to sit very long at this period, but his activities should be changed every few minutes. A wise Scout Master never keeps his boys at any activity more than fifteen minutes at a time unless they are especially wrapped up in the idea. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>wants to scout and the proper way to give instructions to boys about Scouting is by the story or yarn method, which has already been spoken of in this chapter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Neither is Scouting a history of Indian tribes or of any other interesting thing in the community. These may be supplemental and of great value to the Scout, but Scouting first, last and all the time is the development of selfresourcefulness by contact with life and the community through outdoor activities and the daily routine.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Small <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Versus the Older <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>in Progressive</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Results.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A great many Scout Masters have made the serious mistake of starting with smaller boys. Several organizations, splendidly adapted for the development of adolescent boys, have been ruined and discontinued by this very thing. It is easy to get a group of small boys to take up any activity but the fellows whom this movement is going to benefit most are the boys who are somewhat skeptical and have to be shown just what the Scout Master is driving at. A frank, fair statement of the aim and method will meet with generous support from ninety-nine out of every hundred boys. The movement, however, must start with the older boys, and not with the younger.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Patrol Leader and the Scout Master.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Care should be taken by the Scout Master that the patrol leaders do not have too great authority in the supervision<span class='gtxt_body'>
of their patrols. The success of the troop affairs and supervision of patrol progress is, in the last analysis the responsibility of the Scout Master and not that of the patrol leader. There is also a danger, in magnifying the patrol leader in this way, of inordinately swelling the ordinary boy&#39;s head. The activities of the patrol should not be left to the judgment of any patrol leader, and if the Scout Master wants to delegate the work of the patrol and troop, the whole group should reach a decision in regard to the plan. Every patrol leader that a Scout Master has increases his responsibility all the more, and the addition of a patrol to his troop, with its corresponding new patrol leader, means just a little more supervisory work for him.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Team-Work.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The question has been asked, &quot;what shall we do with the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who does not enjoy team work?&quot; If there should be such a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the patrol, of scouting age,&#8212; twelve years, and over,&#8212; you may rely upon it that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is really preadolescent, or has been brought up under such conditions as to stultify the natural order of the adolescent boy&#39;s life. Either the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>must be given time to reach adolescence or the Scout Master must give him extra attention by developing in him the spirit of service,&#8212; the doing of tasks without assistance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Spirit of Money-Making.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The spirit of money getting should be guarded against, because when uncontrolled it has a detrimental effect upon the boys. Boys should not be encouraged to get up plays, entertainments, cut grass, sell articles, or do any one of the thousand things boys can do to earn money for a patrol, when the patrol does not need the money. America is passing through a money-getting age and it is commonly agreed that many of the money-magnates of the United States have caused much of the corrupt government which is existent in so many of our communities. As a teacher of patriotism and citizenship the Scout Master must turn the boy&#39;s attention from the accumulation of funds to the activities of Scouting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Advancement through the Scout Degrees.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Now and then a complaint arises because the boys do not qualify quickly enough for the various degrees of Scouting. It seems that the Tenderfoot once having been admitted to<span class='gtxt_body'>
the patrol and having become a Tenderfoot is in no hurry to become a Second Class Scout, and a Second Class Scout has no desire apparently to make good as a First Class Scout. This should be the abnormal case and the Scout Master in charge of the troop wherever this occurs should bend every energy towards getting the boys to complete the requirements as laid down in the official manual. Otherwise the boys will be merely <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>in name, and not in reality.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Lack of Interest in Patrol or Troop Meetings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Inability to sustain interest in the patrol meetings is given by some Scout Masters for failure to get boys to become enthusiastic in Scouting. The trouble here seems to depend largely on the part of the Scout Master and no doubt, arises from the fact that the Scout Master makes no program for a patrol or troop meeting. The situation will probably change materially just as quickly as the Scout Master knows what he is going to do when he meets his boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Parental Objection and Religious Interference.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Parental objection and religious interference may sometimes effect the advancement of the boys, of the Tenderfoot stage. The Scout Master will have to be very careful what he does when it comes to a matter of parental objection. The Scout Master must in no way interfere with the home, but the difficulty would seem to offer an opportunity for a candid talk with the father and mother of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>showing them just what the idea will accomplish for their son. If the parents still object after this has been done then it is the wisest thing on the part of the Scout Master to drop the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>from the troop.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Scout Master&#39;s Duty, the Sunday School and the Church.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>What has been said of the home may be said also of the religious influences of the community. We can not conceive of a church, Sunday School or religious society which can seriously object to the idea of Scouting, if a clear idea is presented of what Scouting gives to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The Scout Master should stand up firmly against making Scouting a mere bait for the boy&#39;s attendance at either church or Sunday School. But it should always be the duty of the<span class='gtxt_body'>
Scout Master to cooperate willingly and work hand in hand with the boys&#39; religious institutions.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Failure to Keep Engagements. Failure to keep scheduled engagements is given as another reason for failure. This can only be due to lack of interest on the part of the boys. It may be added that a Scout Master having made an engagement with his boys has no right to break that engagement for another, unless it is of the most serious nature. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>has a right to expect just as courteous and serious treatment on the part of the Scout Master as -the Scout Master has on the part of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>Engagements should not be made lightly, and emphasis should be laid not only upon the keeping of the engagement, but its prompt keeping on the part of both the Scout Master and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Working-Boy </span>and His Chance for Scouting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sometimes the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>who are enrolled in the troop or patrols are working boys and have really little time to give to the pleasure and activities of Scouting. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">working-boy </span>question is a little difficult in its solution, but there are very few boys who work more than ten hours a day, and a couple of hours&#39; Scouting in the evening, if given in the form of games and recreation, will not only help the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>as a Scout, but will send him back recreated for his work next day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Need of Strong and Efficient Organizations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A serious mistake of a good many Scout Masters seems to be the looseness of organization in their patrols and troops. The Scout Master does not insist on the boy&#39;s addressing him or the patrol leader in the proper fashion. Anything goes if the boys are pleased, and they are having a good time. No Scout Master will get very far with his boys with such procedure and the insistence on his part of haf ing the boys address him as &quot;Sir&quot; will help him greatly to establish a right kind of spirit in his troop.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Neither should the Scout Master after a Scout meeting of ten or fifteen minutes turn the boys loose to their own devices. The boys will easily keep themselves busy and fill out the time of meeting but this is not the idea of the meeting. The Scout Master has too big a job on his hands and the problem of making manhood and citizenship is too<span class='gtxt_body'>
serious a proposition to be given so little thought and planning. A plan for each meeting and an aim for each plan should be the Scout Master&#39;s slogan.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are some things in connection with Scout work that should be most vigorously guarded against. The Scout Master should by all means guard against athletic leagues of baseball, football, track; basket-ball, etc., within the Scout organization, for nothing will more weaken your development and cause more dissension than an athletic league. Scouting is self-sufficient in itself, and if athletics are substituted for the regular Scout activities in order to keep up a seeming lack of interest in Scouting, something is materially wrong with your leadership or with the temperament of your boys. Athletic games are admirable in theory and usually in practice, and lend a means of excellent development for boys. But competitive athletics have no place in Scout work, and should be assiduously frowned down upon and discouraged. At Silver Bay during the summer of 1910 one hundred and twenty-five boys were present in a Scout camp. They were only one hundred feet from the beach of Lake George, and about one hundred yards from one of the finest amateur athletic fields in the country. In the fifteen days that the boys were in camp, not a single game of baseball was played and but once was there a water meet of any kind. The boys were so busy finding out the things of the woods and were so occupied with the activities as set forth in the official manual that they had no time for the usual play of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Neither should a Scout Master waste his time and energy on indoor scout meets and demonstrations. A scout meet and demonstration is a good thing once or twice a year but the real opportunity and need of Scouting is the close association of a Scout Master and his boys. The time wasted in scout demonstrations and meets could be more profitably employed by the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>learning the things about them and making good in the higher degrees. Linked to baseball, basketball and athletic demonstrations is the idea of a gymnasium. The gymnasium is merely the result of a lack of opportunity to do Scouting. Seventy-five to one hundred years ago when the boys were raised on farms and were in continual touch with everything that tended to build up life, gymnasiums were not heard of. With the development of industrial conditions and the necessity of men,</p>

</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA87'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>women and children living in towns, the gymnasium came into existence as a preserver of health. The Scout Movement is a step towards the old outdoor life that industrial development paralyzed, and a Scout Master is doing very little for a group of boys by providing them with either gymnasium or gymnasium apparatus.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Real Solution of Scout Problems.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A Scout Master in speaking of his Scout work and troop management says: &quot;I try to keep myself in the background, as much as possible. I have insisted on the boys who join my troop knowing what the purposes and objective of Scouting really is. I have made them enroll properly and I am making them do the work of the patrol and troop in their own way.&quot; &quot; This Scout Master&#39;s advice is the solution for every problem that can come up in Scouting. A Sccat Master who is an adviser and the real leader through suggestions, develops the ideal conditions to be realized in real practice of Scouting. Questions of discipline, questions of interest, questions of uniforms and all the business problems that come up to such a Scout Master and his boys will then be greatly simplified or easily solved.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Importance of the Daily Good Turn.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It should be remembered by the Scout Master that the daily good turn is the heart and center of all of the Scout Activities. It is the idea to get the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to look away from himself, and to give some thought and attention to others. The Scout should be urged to do his good turn and once in a while the Scout should tell the Scout Master the things that he has been doing. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>however, should be discouraged from voluntarily telling about his good deeds as a regular thing. He should be taught to let his right hand do things without his left hand knowing anything about them. Do not compel the Scout to tell you the good turns he has done if he does not wish to do so voluntarily; do not ask him to state the things which he has actually accomplished. However, be continually urging him to do his duty with regard to his daily good turn.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Importance of Religion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is maintained by the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America that no <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>can grow into the best kind of a man without recognizing his obligation to God; it is also maintained that no Scout Master can be the best leader of boys unless his per<span class='gtxt_body'>sonal life conforms to the requirements of the faith which he holds. His example should be a constant inspiration to the boys of his troop, causing them, no matter of how many different faiths, to be diligent in their adherence to the teachings of the particular religious institution with which they are individually connected. He should see to it that no boy&#39;s religion is ever ridiculed by another, and that every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is encouraged to live his life according to the ideals of his faith.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>is the Main Issue.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The idea that must continually be kept in mind is the boy&#39;s good and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>rather than Scouting. Half of our teachers in the public schools are trying to teach the subjectmatter of the book when they ought to be teaching the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>they employ static methods. You can get up a goal for attainment and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will reach the goal. Generally, however, he will go no higher than you point. Your teaching should be dynamic rather than static.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Aim to secure balanced, symmetrical activities for your patrols. Remember your Scout is four sided, that he is physical, mental, social and religious in his nature. Do not neglect any one side of him, but get the proper agencies to cooperate with you for these ends. <i>Let the boys do whatever they can. Merely insist on adequate adult supervision. </i>Above all be patient, practical and business like and remember that old heads never grow on young shoulders. <i>The Scout Master should take his place in the community by the side of the teacher of secular and religious instruction. He is an educator and is dealing with the most plastic and most valuable asset in the community </i>&#8212; <i>boyhood. </i>Let him take his task seriously, look upon his privilege with a desire to accomplish great things, and always remember that the good of the boys is his ultimate aim.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Need of Reading and Study in Understanding Boys. The leader of boys to really understand the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>must know something of child life and <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>ideals and principles. The making of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and his individual characteristics begins early in life, and is attended by two great shaping elements, race heredity and local environment. To understand the application of these principles and their effect upon <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>it will be necessary further for the Scout Master to know something of the great movements of history through which man has passed and something as well of the problems of the present in the environmental influences affecting boys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>First of all the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is treated by the majority of modern <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-workers, </span>as a product of race development and heredity, recognizing that in his life from its variest source, the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>relives all the periods of life that stretch into the dim vistas of mammalian and human history. Such a theory of development has been generally accepted by all leaders in the study of race and child psychology. Professor A. F.

<p class='gtxt_body'>stages in the development of the race, both mentally and physically, has been accepted as the cardinal doctrine of the newer theories of education which in the form of child study have made their influence felt in America and in the old world.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Infancy&quot; says Dr. William B. Forbush<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> &quot;is the rehearsal of prehistoric and feral ages, and the years of early childhood are the reproductions of protracted and relatively stationary periods of barbarian days. It is because these ages were so long and so deep; because man has been a savage so much longer than he has been a Christian, that his subconscious heritage needs to be recognized and the work of habit making, which is the analogue of the past, must during childhood be made the central endeavor of ail nurture.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Early Laws of Childhood &#8212; A New Era.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Formerly the laws of childhood were framed by antiquarians who had long forgotten boyhood life and who attempted to make the healthy active boys into men even long before the adolescent period. This is what the average, well-meaning father and mother used to try to do with their beys, before the day of open minded child study brought about a new understanding of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>needs and a new era of development.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Child Resemblance to Savage Civilization.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Child study has brought to notice that the child bears a close resemblance to the savage in his ideas and development. &quot;In many senses it is true,&quot; says Professor Geo. W. Fiske,<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> &quot;that the savage is a child and the child a savage. They both live near to nature &#8212; give them half a chance &#8212; and they know little of the conventions of society. Both live self-centered egotistic lives and are little influenced by public opinion. They live simpler lives, more natural lives than we are apt to live, using simple utensils, and tools; both live in the crude age of culture and intelligence. Both are apt to shun labor, responsibility and care; having little foresight, worrying little and laughing much.&quot; Stanley Hall says of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy</span>:<span class="gstxt_sup">5</span> &quot;In his instincts, amusements and associations, his adjustment to&quot; the life of a savage en</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>vironment is quite stable. &quot;In many ways he resembles the savage and each furnishes the key for understanding both the good and bad points in the other&#39;s character.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Recapitulation Theory.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Based on this close resemblance of child life to the savage life, and because of other likenesses which the child bears at younger periods of its life-stages to earlier ancestral or animal-like forms, biologists and psychologists have deduced the &quot;recapitulation&quot; or &quot;culture epochs&quot; theory. At the very beginning of the human individual life the resemblance is purely biological and physical; but during the growth of the child from two or three years old babyhood into the adult stage, with the consequent mental and moral development, through a series of successive changes in growth, there is a psychological resemblance to the successive social and cultural periods of man-history. Professor Baldwin says,<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> &quot;The individual embryo passes through stages which represent morphologically to a degree the stages actually found in the ancestral animal series.&quot; &quot;That is,&quot; as Prof. Fiske writes, &quot;the human embryo in the uterus, from the time the ovum is fertilized until birth, passes through various stages of development wherein for a larger or shorter period, it resembles some one of its primitive animal ancestors, or more properly their embryo. Although the early periods are recapitulated very rapidly, and the parallelism is doubtless irregular in different embryos, vestiges of these former epochs of development are plainly seen. Shortly before birth the human embryo greatly resembles the embryo of the larger ape (chimpanzee, orang outang, etc.), though each speedily grows unlike the other. From this point it is easy to trace backward the progress of development by which life has ascended.&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">7</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>But for the purpose of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-study, </span>the theory of recapitulation should not be confined to the physical fact alone, but also as well- to the psychic and social. According to such viewpoint, what Mosso<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> said in regard to instinct is interesting; &quot;What we call <i>instinct </i>is the voice of past generations reverberating like a distant echo in the cells of the</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>nervous system. We feel the breath, the advice, the experience of all men, from those who lived on acorns and struggled with wild beasts, dying naked in the forests, down to the virtue and toil of our father, the fear and love of our mother.&quot; Prof. Geo. A. Coe says further,<span class="gstxt_sup">0</span> &quot;As the human body before birth passes through a series of forms that correspond in the main to ascending embryonic forms of animal life in general, so after birth, the mind progresses toward maturity through stages which correspond roughly to the stages of human history in the large. In a certain modified sense, the child is first a savage, then a barbarian, then a civilized being.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When this view of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>is presented to the student the mind of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>becomes like an open book, What was once such an enigma to our fathers is now most easily understood, and the work with boys has therefore been placed on a firm foundation of character-understanding and typeknowledge. &quot;Adolescence begins&quot; says Dr. Winfield S. Hall,<span class="gstxt_sup">10</span> &quot;in boys about the age of fifteen in the average case, although sometimes the beginnings are distinct in the twelfth or thirteenth year, and again are sometimes not evident until the seventeenth year. As the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>emerges from childhood into youth he passes through a pre-adolescent period that represents the emergence of the race from savagery and fetichism into orderly, tribal organizations, and the beginnings of crude industries and early steps of recognition of the rights of others. It was a stormy period of human history. Petty tribal wars decimated the race. When boys are fully launched in their adolescent period, say from the ages of fifteen to eighteen, they represent the next stage of human development. In that stage government is more or less highly organized. Yet it was a time of monarchial rather than democratic government, though the monarchs were frequently elected.&quot; Finally with maturity from eighteen to twenty-four or five, there develops in historical organization, a greater and yet greater spirit of democracy, and general cooperation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>sheer physical force and cunning. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>at this period possesses a high sense of honor, though it is sometimes difficult for older people to understand his view-point. He is amenable to suggestion, and it is possible for a tactful leader, step by step, to develop his code of honor and more surely lead him toward a best development of his personality and resources. This is the goal of the Scout Master in his work with his <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>Later adolescence is characterized by growth of individual prowess, increased physical and mental activity, and a development first, of self-assertiveness and then of cooperation. The whole period of the adolescent <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>is one of immense change.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Physical and Intellectual Restlessness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Physical restlessness is often associated with growing intellectual restlessness and curiosity. &quot;It is a time,&quot; says Dr. Forbush &quot; &quot;of stubborn doubts, painful and dangerous, but signs of mental and moral health. This widening of interests, emotional and intellectual, is accompanied by a gradual social broadening. While in the early part of this period egoistic emotions are apt to be disagreeably expressed, vented sometimes in bullying and again, in an opposite way, by extreme self-consciousness and bashfulness, this sooner or later develops into a clearer recognition of one&#39;s self and a finer recognition of others. Adolescence<span class="gstxt_sup">12</span> has been termed an unselfing. There is a yearning to be with and for one&#39;s kind. This is seen in the growing teamwork spirit in games, and in the various clubs which now spring up almost spontaneously, in the slowly increasing interest in social gatherings, and in the other sex.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Periods of Human History.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The life of man has long been studied in anthropology by dividing his history into several periods of development leading toward civilization. Perhaps the scheme formulated by Morgan is best known. He divided man&#39;s history into two great divisions, Savagery and Barbarism,&#8212; each composed of three successive periods. Savagery was represented by the three periods, early, middle and later; and<span class='gtxt_body'>
Barbarism correspondingly by the three like periods; of early, middle and later. Early Savagery began with natural subsistence on fruit, nuts and roots and ended with the use of a fish diet and the discovery of fire. Middle Savagery, succeeding, ended with the invention of bow and arrow. Later Savagery developed in the mythological period and culminated in the &quot;invention of the art of pottery. Early Barbarism developed village life, and many crude household arts and ended with the cultivation of plants and domestication of animals. Middle Barbarism succeeded, developed agriculture and pastoral arts, and introduced the beginning of a national life. Later Barbarism begins with the use of iron tools and invention of the process of smelting, and developed the art of writing which began literature and led directly to civilization.<span class="gstxt_sup">13</span> Dr. Woods Hutchinson has formulated a scheme based on the method of food getting, and showing reference to child development:&#8212;<span class="gstxt_sup">14</span> Race History and <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Life.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Stages of Evolution of Government and Industry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Prof. Geo. W. Fiske, in order more closely to compare the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life to the race-life has formulated a divisional history scheme of comparison, and considers man&#39;s history from two view-points,&#8212; the evolution of government and the evolution of industry. According to this outline of racial progress the stages of evolution of government are:<span class="gstxt_sup">1B</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. The Primitive Democracy of the savage kinship Clan</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Patriarchal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. The Limited Democracy of the Barbarian Tribe: be</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>coming monarchial when the single tribes ruled by the &quot;council of braves&quot; come* together as allied tribes, under the increasing authority of a &quot; Chieftain by Prowess.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. The Tyrannical period of Feudalism; serfdom, des</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>potism.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. The Revolutionary period which developed the Con</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>stitutional Monarchy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. The Republican period: &#8212; Social Democracy in a</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>self-governing State. The Stages of Industrial Evolution are: &#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Industry developed by the Acquisitive and Collec</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>tional instincts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Industry developed by the Productive and Destruc</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>tive instincts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Industry developed by the Constructive and Trans</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To compare the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>and <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-development </span>according to the theory of recapitulation of the periods of racial progress, the diagram is given on the following page.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>tics. The reasons why boys are so changeable, so restless, and so given to temperamental acts that are so often enigmatical to the adult mind, can be answered by reference to this outline of parallel likenesses between <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life and ancestral race-life. What the boys do is then seen to be natural and most to be expected, and the Scout Master can better foster the greater development of character by building on these race-like desires and appeals, and directing the acquisition of right principles through contact with racial impulses and actions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the period of Childhood, corresponding to the Patriarchal or Communal period, the child yields unquestioned obedience to his parents. He forms only narrow attachments with other playmates, which will later develop into gang organization. The period of Boyhood or the Gang period corresponds racially to the Tribal period, and is characterized by the development and dominance of gang influence over the boys&#39; whole allegiance. The early Adolescent or Chivalry Period is racially parallel to the Feudal or Absolute Monarchial period with its chivalric virtues, vices and actions. At this time the boys&#39; allegiance passes from the gang to the hero or chosen leader; this is the time when the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will try most to be like his father or any one of his men friends whom he looks up to and loves. The period of Middle Adolescence or the self-assertive period corresponds historically to the Revolutionary period and Constitutional Monarchy, and is characterized by his struggle for self-reliance and individual achievement. Late Adolescence, or the Cooperative period is parallel racially to the development of Democracy, and is characterized by growing Social adjustment and cooperation in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>with his fellows and his environment.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Adolescent Types and Characteristics.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Childhood is characterized by simple savage qualities and barbaric virtues, and the development of self-mastery. It develops the brave, the hunter, the chieftain in <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-play, </span>the masterful <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and the bully. Boyhood develops physical strength, agility, skill and endurance, and team play, and as leaders the showy <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>the wrestler and scrapper and the game-leader hero. Early adolescence is characterized by the development of feudal virtues, the doing of good deeds, development of gentleness, resourcefulness, mental alertness, shrewdness, and by complex team play.<span class='gtxt_body'>
During this period there is developed the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>autocrat, the athletic hero, the explorer, the real gentleman and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>criminal. Middle Adolescence develops the pronounced types &#8212; sports, toughs, dudes, vandals,&#8212; the college student and his imitators, the strategist, the &quot;good fellow,&quot; and the young business man, and gives to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in character greater resourcefulness, business success and shrewdness, extreme individuality, mannishness, etc. Later adolescence is characterized by the development in <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-character </span>of popularity, originality, leadership, efficiency, vocational skill, and social grace. Among individual types it develops the debater, the politician, the lawyer, the physician, the artist, the scientist, athletic captain, the man of the world, etc.<span class="gstxt_sup">16</span></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Need of Reading and Study. An understanding then of boys, such as the leader or Scout Master should have, makes necessary the need of the knowledge of psychic changes and their causes. Work with boys planned in accordance with the principles of the recapitulation theory definitely places it on a solid footing, and makes the handling of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>groups so much the easier; Scouting concerns itself with <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>from the pre-adolescent period of boyhood through the changes of adolescence to young manhood, and the Scout Master should therefore familiarize himself with the origin, development, cause, and treatment of the desires and needs and characteristics that form the boy&#39;s life during this period of his life. To do this he should seek to augment his knowledge by all such reading as can be obtained on the subject. This foregoing brief outline of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>development should serve only as aid in pointing out the way for a more thorough study of the subject, just as the whole &quot;Scout Masters&#39; Manual&quot; serves as a source of suggestions in the greater field-work.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To meet a general and imperative demand by the Scout Masters of America, the following programs have been formulated and arranged. They are to be used by the Scout Masters as suggestive aids in connection with the &quot;Handbook for Boys.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As suggestions, the programs are subject to such alterations as to sequence and material as will best meet the particular demands of definite needs and specific localities.

<p class='gtxt_body'>These programs have been planned to provide instruction and progressive advancement in Scout work for a troop of twenty-four boys, or three patrols; and present accurate and detailed material arranged in a progressive manner corresponding to the gradual awakening and manifested ability of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life. </span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Applications &#8212; The Scout Yell &#8212; Temporary Secretary &#8212; Tenderfoot Scout Requirements &#8212; Scout Oath, Scout Sign and Salute &#8212; Knot-Tying and Lariat &#8212; Announcements &#8212; Scout Yells.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>This meeting should be creative of much enthusiasm and contain as many events of appealing interest as possible. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Call the meeting to order and receive the application blanks given out at the first meeting. Be prepared to answer any questions the boys may ask as to these applications, and encourage them to ask for such information. . 2. Lead the boys in the Scout Yell, and in any other good yells which you may deem best for the occasion. Discuss the yell and the reason for it. Point out its application as a pledge reminder of the Scout Motto and the Scout Oath, and its value as serving to create loyalty. The use of the yell has its chief value in bringing the boys together into a closer social compact; it appeals directly to the group instincts of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and is corrective of his self-consciousness. A few yells will serve</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>to create the get-together spirit, and make each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>feel more closely related to the others. Discipline must always be maintained at the meetings, but discipline among your boys means their constant bottling up of some energy that requires an occasional vent or safety valve. The yells supply such a vent, give rise to an increasing interest, and form an attraction to wilder spirits who would never otherwise join a band of quieter boys. <i>It would be a very good thing to have one of the boys lead the others in a few yells at this meeting. The yells and discussion should not continue longer than fifteen minutes. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Turn to page 14 of the Handbook and read the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>Scout Oath aloud, and explain carefully each part <br/>of it. Show the method of taking the oath. <br/>Call attention to the Scout Sign and Scout Salute. <br/>(See also section on the Scout Oath and Scout <br/>Law in the Handbook.) <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. Turn to page 49 of the Handbook and point out the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>methods of knot-tying and the different knots represented. Explain briefly why the knowledge of knots is important, and the practical uses for the different knots. Have materials ready so that each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>may practice whipping the rope ends and the tying of several knots under your guidance. Go carefully through the preliminary steps and make sure that each lad understands them. Ask questions as to the three qualities of a good knot, and let the boys answer from the Handbook. Also have an upright in the hall, or something similar, and plenty of rope so that the boys can practice lassoing; show them the correct method of preparing the loop, and of holding and throwing the rope. Encourage them to learn as many of the knots as possible and to practice with the lasso at home, so that at the next indoor meeting, contests can be held to see who has become most proficient with the lasso and as knot-tyer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. Set a definite time for your next meeting.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This program presupposes that nearly all of your boys have obtained copies of the &quot; Handbook for Boys,&quot; or have been encouraged to do so as soon as possible. By this time those who have books are beginning to use them intelligently, and all want to take up some sort of actual scout practice as soon as possible. So this meeting should be replete with interesting events, and the boys should be told </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>that the next meeting will be outdoors in the country or woods for the practice of actual scouting. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Open your meeting with a few yells.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Receive new applications for membership, and wel</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>come such applicants.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Display the National Flag and Scout emblems, and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ask the boys to explain the Scout&#39;s pledge to the Flag. Also explain the drill formation, and have a practice of the drill and Scout Salute to the officer (Scout Master) and the Flag.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Relate the history of the American Flag, and explain</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>its composition. Ask the boys what other national flags they have ever seen, and what the colors and emblems represented, etc. Refer them to the first few pages of any Unabridged Dictionary for picture-plates of different national flags, or, if such a book is handy, let each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>have a look at the pictures. If the boys know the tune of the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; it might be well to sing one or two verses of that song. (For song see page 358 of Boys&#39; Handbook.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Again call attention to the requirements for Tender</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>foot, and set the 5th meeting as the definite time for the Tenderfoot examinations. Have each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>repeat as many points of the Scout Law as he has yet memorized, and emphasize the need to <i>&quot;Be Prepared.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. Give the boys something to do in the way of exer</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>cise, such as Hand Wrestling (page 303, B. H.), Shop Window Indoors (page 309, B. H), <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts&#39; </span>Nose Indoors (page 310, B. H), or any other applicable game or exercise.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. Speak of the &quot;Daily Good Turn,&quot; and emphasize</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the need of it. Arrange with the boys to be able to give a report of the good turns that they have accomplished during the ensuing days at the next meeting. Impress the value of service.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. Call attention to Chapter 7 of the Boys&#39; Handbook</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and the proper carriage each Scout should seek to maintain. Speak of the benefit of bathing and proper eating and the right amount of sleep, and the need for being physically &quot;<i>prepared.&quot; </i>Demonstrate and practice for a period of ten or<span class='gtxt_body'>
twelve minutes a series of the first four or five setting-up exercises. Encourage the boys to continue the same at a definite time every morning or night. 9. Arrange definitely for the next meeting, which should come on a Saturday or a half-holiday and be held in the country or woods. Outline the program for this first hike, arrange for the proper materials needed en route, and for lunch, and advise the boys as to what sort of clothes and shoes they should wear. Also have it understood that there is to be a preliminary test for Tenderfoot requirements at the noon rest, and that they should &quot;Be Prepared&quot; in all ways. Be sure to set a definite time and place for the start. 10. Close your meeting with a yell practice. Explain the common flag language by demonstration with a flag upside down, at half mast, at full mast, etc., giving their respective meanings. Emphasize the love for the flag, and urge the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>to always reverence and protect their national colors. Also refer to the pledge to the flag and explain its significance.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This is an importa1\t meeting and should be well prepared. All arrangements should be completed, and all needed materials should be collected and put in their proper places. By previous announcement at earlier meetings you have informed the boys that the Tenderfoot examination will be held at this time. You have also arranged at a previous indoor meeting that this will be the date for the lasso and the knot-tying contest. You have instructed the boys to prepare for their &quot;Daily Good Turn&quot; reports. And you have requested them to turn in written lists of their outdoor observations of animal and plant life.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Open the meeting with a few well-chosen words of</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Call for drill formation, display the National Flag,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and have the Troop give the Scout Salute and the Scout Sign.

<p class='gtxt_body'>6. Call for the &quot;Daily Good Turn&quot; Reports. <i>The </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This is another important meeting and should be well prepared for in advance. You announced at the last indoor meeting that at this meeting those who had successfully passed the examinations would be sworn in as Tenderfoot </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts. </i></span><i>This &quot;Swearing in&quot; ceremony should be invested with privacy and as much dignity as the occasion will warrant. The </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Boy Scouts </i></span><i>as an organization is not in any sense a secret order, but the importance of conferring the different Scout ranks upon the boys will loom large in their minds if the knowledge of investiture is not shared with everybody. Moreover, it would appeal to the boy&#39;s inherited social tendencies to invest the ceremony with a formal dignity and use some simple form of initiation. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>In preparing for this meeting, care should be taken to have all the arrangements carefully completed. The Tenderfoot badges must be ordered in plenty of time, and all materials needed be in readiness for the occasion.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. <i>Badges should not be ordered until after boys have </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>actually complied with the requirements prescribed by the National Council and are entitled to receive them. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. <i>All orders for badges should be sent in by the Scout </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Master with a certificate from the Local Council that these requirements have been complied with. Blanks for this purpose may be secured on application to the National Headquarters. Where no Local Council has been formed, application for badges should be sent direct to Headquarters, signed by the registered Scout Master of the troop, giving his official number. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. <i>Scout Commissioners&#39;, Scout Masters&#39; and Assistant </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Scout Masters&#39; badges can be issued only to those who are registered as such at National Headquarters. The Tenderfoot badges are seven-eighths of an inch wide and are made either for the buttonhole or with a safety-pin clasp; when ordering state which is preferred. As it will be necessary in a very short time.to elect the Patrol Leaders, these badges should also be ordered at this time; the price is five cents, the same as for the other Tenderfoot badges. (See page </i>13, <i>B. H.) </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>It might be a good thing to invite the parents of the boys to this meeting, and if this is done, seating arrangements must be made for those who care to come. There should also be present the Court of Honor or at least one member of that body to announce the report of the Tenderfoot examinations, and lend importance to the occasion. If it is decided to have the parents present at this meeting, it would be a very good idea to have some man who is well known and looked up to by the boys to make a fiveminute talk on the Scout Movement; if this is arranged for, you should see that he is well posted. The Information Bulletin issued by National Headquarters will serve the purpose. Have present some gentleman well known to the community, a lawyer or judge if possible, who will make a five-minute speech on &quot;Law and Its Place and Value in Good Citizenship!&#39; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Open the meeting with the Scout Yells.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>3. Have the address on the Scout Movement by the in</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>vited speaker, if such an event has been arranged for.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>4. Have the report of the Tenderfoot examinations</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>made. The speaker should be prepared with a list of the percentages, and should make a suitable comment.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>5. You, as Scout Master, should read the Scout Oath</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and explain briefly what each phrase means. This repeated explanation of the Scout Oath serves two purposes: It instructs the visitors or the parents who are present as to the meaning and value of the Oath, and it is valuable because by its formal presentation at such a time, when the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is impressed by the dignity of the occasion, the Oath as a whole and its meaning will appeal to him in a stronger light and attain an increased importance and significance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>6. Announce the address on &quot; The Idea of Law and Its</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Place and Value in Good Citizenship,&quot; and introduce the speaker. The speaker should be previously instructed to read the Scout Law, at the end of his speech, and with a brief comment show how it teaches the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to become a good citizen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>7. The investiture of the Scout to the rank of Tender</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>foot should now begin. The regular ceremonial <br/>follows: <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>a. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>are called to stand at attention, <br/>      and the Scout Master asks the following: <br/>        (1) <span class="gstxt_hlt">&quot;Scouts, </span>you have given careful <br/>                 attention to the reading of the <br/>               Scout Oath and Scout Law; you <br/>              have also passed the required <br/>                  tests and have become eligible <br/>                 to the full rank of Tenderfoot <br/>                Scout. Is there anything about <br/>                the Oath or Law that you do <br/>               not understand?&quot; <br/><span class="gstxt_hlt">                 Scouts, </span>in unison, answer: <br/>                &quot;No, sir.&quot; <br/>           [(2). &quot;Is there any reason why you <br/>                should not take the promise of <br/>                the Scout Oath?&quot; <br/></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>answer: &quot;There is not, sir.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>b. The Scout Master then continues as follows:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;In the olden days a knight gave help and protection to other men and women whenever he had the opportunity to do so. A solemn promise upon his honor was always exacted before a man could become a knight. You are the knights of these. modern times in America. The promise those men made was called an oath. It was not, however, the same kind of an oath that we make in our courts of law. It was a solemn promise that they would always be pure and honorable, loyal and true, and would help all those who needed assistance. This is the meaning of our Scout Oath, and as you are sworn in as Tenderfoot <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>you are to keep this in mind.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>c. The Scout Master then proceeds to admin</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ister the Scout Oath as follows:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>(Note.</i>&#8212; <i>The Scout Master should always administer the Oath and conduct the investiture ceremonial in order to strengthen his influence on the boys.) </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>(i) The Scout Master arranges the <br/>       boys in a large half circle, so <br/>        that they stand side by side and <br/>          all face his position, which <br/>       should be at least seven or eight <br/>         feet from the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>immediately <br/>         in front of him. <br/>(2) He will then say: &quot;Place your <br/>        heels together and give the Scout <br/>        Salute.&quot; When this is done by <br/>        the boys, he continues: &quot;The <br/>       Scout Salute, with the three fin- <br/>        gers upright and together, re- <br/>       minds the Scout of the three <br/>       promises of the Scout Oath. <br/>      You will now repeat the Oath <br/>        after me, in this manner.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(giving full name), promise on my honor that I will do my best,&quot; etc. The Scout Master will then give the Scout Oath with sufficient pauses so that the applicants will have no difficulty in repeating the successive phrases after him. At the time of taking the Oath the applicant will stand holding up his right hand, giving the Scout Sign. (3) When the Scout Oath has been taken, the Scout Master will say: &quot;<span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>I now give you the grasp of the Tenderfoot and welcome you into our ranks as members of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America. May your progress be ever onward and upward.&quot; As he says this, the Scout Master passes around to each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in succession, giving him the handshake, d. The investiture to Tenderfoot rank now takes place. The Scout Master will now ask and receive answer to the following questions: Scout Master &#8212;&quot; What Scout rank do</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>you seek?&quot; <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>(in unison)&#8212;&quot; The rank of Tenderfoot.&quot; Scout Master&#8212;&quot;Have you completed your tests before the Court of Honor?&quot; <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>&#8212;&quot; Yes, sir.&quot; When the examination reports are announced earlier in the evening, each successful applicant should be furnished with a certificate of passing.

The ability to trail half a mile in twenty-five minutes should be easily accomplished by any <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>not a cripple, as the average rate of walking for a man is fifteen minutes per mile. &quot;Scout&#39;s Pace,&quot; or Requirement 5, already practiced at a previous meeting, might also be used again at this time for a short distance, so that all of the boys may understand thoroughly what it is and learn to do it properly.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>3. - If a previous location for the noon camp has already 1 been agreed upon, two boys might be selected to j serve as &quot;hares&quot; and sent out ahead with their</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>pockets full of confetti paper or shelled corn, and everybody thus join in a game of &quot;Follow the Trail.&quot; (See page 310, B. H.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>4. Arrived at a suitable location for the camp, it would</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>be best to have one or two instructive games before the preparations for lunch. As the consideration of the compass is most important, and as the 10th Requirement makes necessary a knowledge of its sixteen principal points, you should proceed to give a practical field demonstration of its use. The following games are suggested as a help in the instruction, to create interest in the practical use of the compass and to engender in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>a desire for a more thorough knowledge of determining proper directions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>a. &quot;Boxing the Compass&quot; Take a suitable point as a center and from it take bearings for the principal sixteen points of the compass about eleven paces each from the center point. Since the radius of your circle will then be thirty-three feet, your points will be approximately about twelve feet apart. Instruct the boys how to take bearings and establish the points. By demonstration establish the main points North and South yourself. Have the boys, by group, locate the other points around the circle according to instruction and advice, and- then check up to see that the distances are nearly approximate. Mark each point thus established with a stake or something similar and attach thereto a properly labeled card. <i>These cards should be prepared in advance </i>&#8212; <i>heavily inked letters, readable at some distance, on square pieces of cardboard from five to seven inches on side, and each should by its lettering represent one of the compass points, as N., NNE., NE., ENE., E., etc. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the points have all been properly marked, have the boys select four of their<span class='gtxt_body'>
number to choose up sides, and when this in turn has been done, each side will in its proper turn start at the North point and &quot;Box the Compass&quot; in the proper way with the use of these sixteen points three successive times around the circle. This is done in the following way:</span></p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA123'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Suppose one side, to be lined up at the North point, then the leader will take his position at this point and call out loudly, North, then the second <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will run on to the next point along the outer border of the circle, and call out in the same way North Northeast, and the next <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will do the same with the next point and call out Northeast. There will be a certain time limit established in getting around the circle &#8212; a matter for you to determine each time the game is played, because of the changing conditions. If there should be six boys on each side, each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>would therefore occupy eight points during the three times around, and so should obtain a very good idea of the correct sequence of points. Every mistake made in calling out will count as a forfeit and every minute over the required time will count as three forfeits. When each side has had three trials around the compass with marked points, all the cardmarkers are taken away except the one at the North point, and each side has three more times around in the same manner as before. That side having the least number of forfeits at the close of the game will be declared winners. The rules to observe follow:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(1) Each side will start at the North</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>point.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(2) The run from point will be on the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>outer edge of the circle and never across the circle.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(3) Each point shall be called out</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>loudly and distinctly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(4) The Scout Master or referee shall</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>stand at the center point, and be<span class='gtxt_body'>
careful to score each slight mistake with full count. <i>When the boys have become fairly proficient in the knowledge and relative position of these points, the game can be made more complex by the use of all the points of the compass </i>&#8212; <i>thirtytwo in number. They will then be approximately six feet apart. And the game will, of course, be played in the same manner as in the simpler form. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>b. Compass Points</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>This game should be played only after the boys have become more or less familiar with the relative positions of all of the principal points of the compass. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This game is similar to the other compass game and requires the same general preparation in taking bearings, locating points, and establishing a ground plan of a compass. Suppose the points are all properly located and marked with the prepared cards, the game is then ready to begin. Have two boys choose up sides, and have the group that is to begin the game stand ten or twelve feet away from the North point, and outside the circle with their backs thereto. Assign to each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the group some one compass point to locate, when the signal is given. At the given signal the boys make a rush for their respective positions, and all those who do not get to their correct places in a certain limit of time forfeit one point. <i>Of course, the boys might start from the center point of the circle instead of the North point, and if such is the case, they will stand facing the Scout Master or referee at the center point while the location points are being assigned. Since only one side contests at a time, the other side w1ll help the referee in watching out for mistakes. It will be by far the best to have previously prepared cards representing by lettering each a compass point, and after shuffling at the </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>beginning of the game these cards should be dealt out and pinned on the boys&#39; coats or shirts at each new assignment of location points; the letters, of course, should be large enough to be readable at some distance. </i></span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The time limit for reaching points should be determined in each case according to the conditions and distance, etc. The sides will alternate in trials with different location points assigned to each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>each time (cards dealt out, if cards are used) ; there should be two trials, each with unmarked points. The side making the least number of forfeitures during the set number of trials will be declared winners. This game can also be varied by making use of all thirty-two points of the compass, when the boys are ready for it. The game will be played the same in each case. The rules to observe follow in outline:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(1) During assignments the boys will</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>stand with their backs to the points; any <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>caught looking to see where he is to go, before the signal is given, will forfeit three points.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(2) Each mistake made will count for</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>two forfeits.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(3) Each contestant will forfeit one</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>point if he does not get to his place within the limit time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(4) Each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>caught directing another</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>of his own side to the proper position will forfeit three points. 5. Demonstrate the correct use of knife or hatchet, and the correct way to build and light a fire, giving definite explanations as to the best manner of preparing material, laying wood in place, holding match, etc. <i>Failure to meet the Second-Class test is often due to the fact that not enough wood is prepared at the start. Success in the fire-lighting contest is often due to proper regard of this important point. It will be best to read over the article on page </i>158, <i>B. H., on the building of a camp</i><span class='gtxt_body'><i>fire, as that article contains several helpful suggestions. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. Have the boys practice building and lighting a fire,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>using only two matches. Let the boys do it without advice &#8212; singly or in groups of two.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. Prepare for lunch and camp-fire as in the previous</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>outdoor meeting, and be sure to give each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>some definite thing to do in the preparation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. At the end of the lunch, clean up the camp, put out</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the fires in the proper way, etc. And then, if the boys would like it and the time will warrant, tell or read a good camp story.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>9. Divide the boys into groups of four each, send them</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>out at proper distances from one another and from your station at the center, and begin the practice of the practical application of the Morse or some other signal code. Each group station should be within sight of your station, where there will also be located one of the groups, and communications by questions and answers carried on from this central location. Each group should have a copy of the Boys&#39; Handbook and a wig-wag flag, and. each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in each group should alternate in the sending and receiving of messages. <i>The Morse Code and instruction in its use should previously be looked over and explained before the groups are sent out, but the best method of getting instruction will, of course, be in actual practice. For the Code and instructions, see page 202 and top of page 204, B. H. It might also be well to practice at this time the whistle signs and commands as given on page 208, B. H. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>You should prepare for this meeting by having present a physician, surgeon, or competent nurse who will consent to deliver a short address on the Care of the Body, and give instruction in Elementary First Aid. Several rolls of bandages, splints, adhesive tapes, court-plaster, arm slings, etc., will likewise be necessary, and should be in readiness. If a physician has consented to be with you on this occasion, he perhaps would also be quite willing to conduct a physical examination of all the boys in the Troop; if he is interested in boys, he might consent to act as the regular examiner for the patrols or Troop. A </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>boy </i></span><i>should know the condition of his heart and lungs before entering any athletic contest. If he has any defects in his breathing apparatus </i>&#8212; <i>nose, throat, or lungs</i>&#8212;<i>these should be attended to or they will seriously interfere with his endurance tests and his entire physical development. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>It would be a very good idea to have a physical examination of each Scout as soon after he has become a Tenderfoot Scout as possible, and to conduct a similar examination of the same Scout once every six months thereafter and as long as he remains a </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Boy </i></span><i>Scout. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>This meeting might be held on any week night, in order to best conform to the physician&#39;s time or convenience, but, if on a night other than Friday or Saturday, care should be taken that the boys do not neglect their preparation for the next day at school. The School </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Boy </i></span><i>Scout should remember the Scout Motto </i>&#8212; <i>to &quot;Be Prepared&quot;</i>&#8212; <i>and should also remember the first point of the Scout Law </i>&#8212;<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Yells. <i>Note.</i>&#8212; <i>One announcement that should be made at this time is that the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>should prepare for the nomination and election of their Patrol Leaders at a near date, and should have someone in mind who would make good leaders, by that time. And you should announce, further, that those who will be elected at that time will then be eligible to take the special tests given to Patrol Leaders of Tenderfoot Scout Rank, said tests to be secret, to be taken for the purpose of proving special ability and efficiency as </i>a <i>Tenderfoot Scout, and to be given by the Scout Master. And you should announce that the final organization of the </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>Troop will be completed at that coming meeting. By this time you, yourself, %vi!l have noted who in your Troop are the natural leaders among the boys: these fellows will make the best Patrol Leaders, if they can pass the efficiency tests, and are worthy and can be encouraged to strive toward better standards of excellence. Always let the boys choose their own Patrol Leaders by popular vote, subject only to certain attainments of proficiency as </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>and to your best judgment; never allow likes or dislikes or favoritism to influence you in the approval of their choice. Have it understood, however, that no Tenderfoot Scout can become a Patrol Leader unless he can attain a grade of 90 per cent, in the Tenderfoot Examination Test, and that no Scout can pass the test with a grade of 85 per cent. If the elected leader is not proficient in the special test, the Assistant Patrol Leader elect will become Patrol Leader in his place if able to pass the test successfully. And, further, that if neither elected leader can pass the requirements, another election must take plate for two more </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>to make a trial, etc. It is the natural leaders that will be the best leaders, and that you will want most, if they can be en~ couraged to make themselves the most proficient, and become best &quot;prepared.&quot; In each group of a dozen or more boys there are always a few who come to the front as leaders, and the others will sooner or later fall into the habit of following the dictates or advice or example of these few. These are the chaps you will need to look out for, because, if they can be influenced and guided by your good advice and personal contact with them to develop their natural ability to lead others along the right lines, you will need to look no farther for Patrol Leaders, for you have in them for such leadership in the making the best material in the country. </i></span></p>

If the trees are in leaf, have each </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>boy </i></span><i>take with him on the </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>hike any sort of a magazine or booklet so that it may be used for the collection and storing of leaves for your treestudy contest. A preparerd lunch should be taken along </i>&#8212; <i>such as meat and egg sandwiches, cheese, cookies, etc., and each Scout should likewise have with him his staff, a plate and a cup, matches, a candle, and a knife or hatchet, and suitable straps to attach the little pack thus collected to the back; before starting out you should see that the packs are properly adjusted, and demonstrate the correct manner of carrying any sort of a pack on the back. It would be best for each </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>boy </i></span><i>to have a haversack by this time (see page 363, B. H.), for there will soon be need of one for the over-night hikes, and it proves very handy as an ,easy and adjustable pack. Another handy thing, of course, to have along on the hike is the individual mess-kit (see page 364, B. H.) For information in regard to the necessary staff, see page 365, B. H. Several small coffee-pots should be taken with you, as well as enough ground coffee or cocoa to supply the Troop (also a can of condensed cream and a small quantity of sugar in cans). Among other things, you should also be supplied with wig-wag flags and several small compasses, if the latter can be obtained for the occasion; likewise, you should have previously looked over and made what corrections you thought best on the maps or d1rection-plats which were handed in at the last meeting, and these should be taken along for discussion during the afternoon. For this afternoon hike some place should be chosen that is already fairly well known to all members of the Troop, and before starting out you should make a rough sketch or map of the chosen locality, showing directions from known landmarks, trend of streams, roads, fence-lines, etc. This little map will prove of great value for use in scouting games, and serve as an excellent demonstration of the working value of such a sketch in practical scouting. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1. By the aid of your previously prepared map, study the locality into which you are going, so that before the actual start is made each Scout in the Troop will have some knowledge of the lay of the land, possible directions to be taken, etc. When this has been done pick out some well-known place on the map that will serve as a rendezvous, and play the the game of &quot; Scouting&quot; (page 298, B.<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>As it will probably take some little time for all of the groups to arrive and report, as soon as two or three groups arrive and finish reporting it will be best to start a game of &quot; Hat-Ball &quot; to keep those occupied who have finished. However, before the boys start playing the game they should be instructed to dispose of their packs and staff, and lay the same aside in a neat and orderly manner. The game should be continued, taking in the later comers as they arrive, until all the groups have reached the rendezvous and properly reported.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Propose a tree-study contest and outline its principles and procedure. Such a game or contest ought to prove interesting to the boys and certainly would be highly instructive in observation and naturestudy. Announce that the contest will be continued for the next four or five ensuing meetings, and set a definite date at which the results of the contest will be decided. <i>The suggestions as to plan and principles of the contest follow: Have the boys collect leaves from as many different trees and bushes as they can find. The leaves, while in the field, can be kept between pages of a magazine taken along for that purpose, but are to be posted each on a separate page of a note-book when the Scout again reaches home.

The best note-book for general use would probably be one about eight inches by twelve; in this the leaf should be laid flat and firmly pasted in about the center of a page. On the opposite page to each leaf should appear its record, all the information in regard to the genus or species that the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>boy </i></span><i>can obtain. The Scout who collects and records the largest number of different kinds of leaves, who gathers the best information for the record, and who makes up the neatest looking book will be declared the winner of the contest. Encourage the boys to come to you between meetings, if they need further information in regard to planning the book and affixing the leaves. In such cases merely paste in one or two leaves and point out the place for the record; let them do the rest, as it is their own work and experience in this that will help them most. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>4. Have a practice of the signal code by means of the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>wig-wag, as suggested in Program IX.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>5. Play one of the Compass Games with all thirty-two</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>points of the compass in use. <i>Let the boys lay out the ground circle and locate the points themselves, with the aid of the small compasses. Do not give them advice unless it is absolutely necessary. Inorder to ascertain what information the boys have gained as to direction, it would be a good thing to pick several out at random, and placing a small compass in their hands, ask them to explain its use. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>6. If there is still time before dark, it would be ex</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>7. As evening shadows begin to fall begin preparation</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>for the lunch and camp-fire. As there will be need of several smaller fires for boiling coffee, as well as the larger camp-fire, there will be plenty to do in looking for wood and preparing it for use. Give each Scout some definite thing to do that will keep him busy. Have a fire-building contest by<span class='gtxt_body'>
groups of three boys each, best fire and speed to be counted. The winning group should be given the privilege of building the larger camp-fire; while the best of the others can be used for boiling the coffee, etc. As there will probably be need of six such small fires for this purpose, it would be best to assign four <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>each to a fire. Give each group a coffee-pot and the proper amount of coffee, and explain to them how to &quot;make&quot; it; let them do the actual preparation in each case.</span></p>

If the practice is to be in the open, there will be no need of taking lunch or spending more than a couple or three hours in practice. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>thing to do, and should rotate in their duties in a certain fixed and prearranged order. One should handle the wig-wag flags, another should act as the bearer of messages or assignments from group to group, another should serve as the receiver of messages, with Boys&#39; Handbook, note-book and pencil, and another should serve as a reserve, helping to receive messages or to carry out instructions.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This is another important meeting and should be well arranged for and carefully planned in advance. The following general suggestions may help out considerably, but you as Scout Master should be on the lookout for something interesting to add to the list of events of the evening, something of appealing interest to the boys, and something that will, of its own nature, lead to a greater efficiency of organisation. It is suggested that the evening program be divided into parts, the first part to consist of entertainment and exercises. A speaker should be secured beforehand who will consent to give a short address on &quot;Efficiency in Organisation.&quot; It will make a very pleasant evening, and be doubly enjoyable to the boys, as an aftermath of the business program, to arrange for the serving of light refreshments during the latter part of the evening. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>By this time you will have observed which ones of your boys are the leaders among the others, and are best fitted by ability and efficiency to become Patrol Leaders. You have made previous announcements to the boys to think over the situation and have in mind the best suitable candidate among them on patrol names, and they should be ready to give their final report at this meeting. Where it is thought best to have a constitution and by-laws for the troop organisation you, as Scout Master, should be ready </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>with the draft of a suggested simple form.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Call for a report of the Committee on Names, and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>when this has been given allow five or six minutes for the free discussion of the names by the different patrols, and then call for the adoption of a name for each patrol in order by majority vote.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. If it is decided to consider the adoption of a consti</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>tution and by-laws, let it be understood that such conditions shall apply to the entire troop organization, and that the rules and regulations so adopted shall apply equally to members of both troop and the different patrols. It is suggestively urged that some simple form of constitution be considered, and if this is done, the Scout Master will appoint two or three members of each patrol to confer with him as to the suggested draft<span class='gtxt_body'>
already prepared, and to any new measures that may be considered. Arrange for the report of this meeting at the next indoor meeting, and the adoption of the constitution and by-laws at that time. 5. Conduct the nomination and election of Patrol Leaders and Assistants.</span></p>

For those to whom it might be helpful, a model constitutional form for </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Boy Scouts </i></span><i>is given in Chapter VI. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Besides the discussion of the constitutional measures and their subsequent adoption, there is also to be the installation ceremonies of those Patrol Leaders and Assistant Patrol Leaders who have been successful in passing the efficiency tests. The boys should understand that the positions are both elective and competitive; this knowledge of the aspirants for the different offices that there are to be competitive tests ahead of them will serve to eliminate the fellows who are natural shirkers, to deter those from seeking or accepting the positions who are not efficient to serve as Patrol Leaders, and who, having attained their positions by popularity, might later not live up to the responsibilities of their positions.

It should be previously understood that the special tests are to consist of a special Tenderfoot Scout Requirement examination together with a general test in the efficiency of the most practiced Second-Class Scout Requirements, to show that the candidate for office is up to date in all his knowledge. Further, that Patrol Leaders must pass the Tenderfoot Scout Requirement test with a grade of </i>90 <i>per cent- to be eligible for office, and the Assistant Patrol Leaders must haze a grade of </i>85 <i>per cent.; in the general test for Second-Class Scout Requirements the former should pass with a grade of </i>60 <i>per cent, and the latter with a grade of </i>50 <i>per cent. If the elected Patrol Leaders fail to pass, the elected Assistant Patrol Leaders, if making the correct grade, will then become the Patrol Leaders.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Answer: &quot;We do.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scout Master: &quot;Repeat after me the following, one at a time: I Scout <i>(Menser) </i>accept the responsibility that my fellow</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>have put upon me and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>will to the best of my ability</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>perform the duties of Patrol Leader (or</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Assistant Patrol Leader) of the <i>(Bear) </i>Patrol.&quot; <i>The Scout Master will repeat slowly with pauses at the dashes, and repeats the same ceremony with each candidate. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scout Master: &quot;T, therefore, in acknowledgment of your promise and election, give you the Scout Grip and declare you Patrol Leader (or Assistant Patrol Leader) of the <i>(Bear) </i>Patrol. I take great pleasure in decorating you with your badge of leadership.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>This foregoing ceremony is to be repeated for each Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader, making the appropriate changes for each Scout and Scout-office. The Scout Grip consists of a handshake with the right hand, with the fingers in the same position as in making the Scout Sign. One Scout shakes hands with another by a good warm </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>handclasp, with the three middle fingers extended in a straight line along the other&#39;s wrist, and with the thumb and little finger clasped around the other&#39;s fingers. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>For this meeting obtain the use of some unused yard or lot about town, preferably where there is a tree or two standing in the lot, but even a vacant city lot will serve the purpose fairly rvcll. Also obtain just for this occasion the use of several tents of different kinds; there will probably be several owners of merchandise in your locality who will be glad to loan their property for such a purpose, providing due care of it is taken. If you are not yourself familiar with tent raising get someone who does know about tenting and camp life, who will be willing to give a demonstration on the methods of putting up tents and their practical uses. Read carefully the art1cle in the Boys&#39; Handbook on &quot;Tents,&quot; pages </i>164-173, <i>and study well the diagram on page </i>169. <i>Obtain three pieces of unbleached cotton cloth, </i>90 <i>inches wide and </i>5 <i>yards long (one for the use of each patrol), and see that proper rings are attached for demonstration purposes. Be sure to obtain also a sufficient supply of ropes and pegs, etc. See that the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>take with them their knives or hatchets for use in making tent pegs, where needed, etc. Before the day for the meeting it would be best to practice us1ng the tent-cloths as per direction in the article just referred to, so that you may become proficient in the art of setting up the different tent styles, and can give proper demonstrations without any bother or hindrance of inexperience. Tins meeting will require the greater part of an afternoon. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Having all met at a certain place, or at the vacant lot</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>to be used for the meeting, get to work as soon as possible. There is plenty to be done.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Give a demonstration of raising and taking down dif</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ferent kinds of tents. Let the boys ask questions. When the boys have watched proceedings a couple of times, set them to work by patrols in setting up and taking down the same tents. Do not give any more advice than is absolutely necessary. If there are three tents (if there is only one patrol, the patrol might be divided into two parts), there might easily be a tent-raising contest for speed and abil<span class='gtxt_body'>ity, after the boys have experimented by raising and taking down the tents a couple of times.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>leadership of Patrol Leaders and Assistant Patrol -Leaders and have the tents pitched in orderly arrangement. You will act as inspector, and pronounce judgment upon the results. <i>The tents in use should be large enough to accommodate at least four </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>to the tent. This would arrange matters so that there would be a Patrol Leader or an Assistant with each group. Also erect poles for the American camp flag, and for patrol flags. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>4. If the start is made shortly after noon on a holiday</p>

In such case, deploy the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>in different directions in half-patrols, and proceed with Morse Code or Semaphore signal practice. If, however, the start is made after school on a Friday afternoon, and there should still be some time left over, play a few games like &quot; Hat-Ball&quot; to liven things up a bit, and to more likely secure enough weariness to insure at least some sleep during the night.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>6. As soon as supper is prepared, all will sit down at</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>some place near the camp-fire to enjoy their meal. During the course of the meal you will give out final tent and bed assignments, and outline camp rules for the night.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>From now on, until the Second-Class Scout examinations, as much time as possible should be given to practice with the signal code and first aid to the injured, as these are the most difficult requirements to master. Accordingly practice either in one or the other should be given at every meeting, where possible, up to the time of the actual tests. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>For this meeting you should also have in readiness a small metal plate or flat and smooth metal surface, a small quantity of printer&#39;s ink, and a small rubber roller with which to spread the ink on the metal surface. A round piece of glass, such as the side of a drinking glass will do as well as the metal plate. If possible too, try to find and glance over some book treating of physiognomy or facial features, usually there will be some such books in every fairly equipped library. </i></p>

point home that Nature does not duplicate herself in identical looks or marking or shapes not even in the leaves of the trees, that each leaf has its own identity, and by careful observation can be easily told from all other leaves on the same tree or any other tree. <i>Hold the books over for one meeting for more careful examination into the sort of results that are being obtained in nature study. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>4. Play the observation games such as &quot;Scout&#39;s Nose</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Indoors&quot; and &quot;Kim&#39;s Game.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>5. Call the attention of the boys to the difference in</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>their identity, how that each one differs from the other in shape of head or nose or skin, in color of eyes and hair, in stature, in manner of speech, etc. Point out the differences in shapes of the head, colors of the eye, colors and texture.of hair, shapings of the ear, and show how any Scout can be easily identified from any of the others by an observation of just any one of these physical characteristics. Make out a number of cards on which descriptions are given of certain physical characteristics of the face and head, etc., and distribute these cards without names to certain of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>in order that they may try in a limited time to find the subject of the description among the other <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>present. If these <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>fail or any one of them fails, let others have a trial either with the same or new cards. Score points for the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>who are successful.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>6. Briefly discuss finger-prints, and their use as a means</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>of identification. Have the boys examine the markings of the lines on the finger tips, and point out how different they are in arrangement not only on the same hand, or the same person, but on any number of hands of different persons. Show<span class='gtxt_body'>
method of taking record of anger-prints and the simple materials needed for use. Take an impression of the fingers of each Scout, with his signature, and pass them out to them respectively as mementos of the occasion. <i>Spread the printer&#39;s ink on the metal plate with the rubber roller, press the tips of the fingers with a slight pressure to the metal surface and then to a piece of blank paper. If the glass is used, the rubber roller is used to roll the ink on the glass, then the finger tips are rolled slightly on the glass, and the glass in turn rolled on the paper. A little practice makes the taking of impressions very easy, and either method should give good results. The glass method is the one most in use in the United States Navy. Printer&#39;s ink takes the best impressions as the other ink is liable to blur. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>pass games, one patrol to prepare material to carry out Requirement 8, and one patrol to try out in Requirements 6 and 7. In latter case each one of the eight in the patrol should work alone, and the examiner should give his attention to the grading of results. As soon as this first patrol have finished in this examination, they should continue in &quot;trial of Requirement 8, working this time in pairs &#8212; one preparing the meat and the other the potatoes. At the same time the second patrol &#8212; those detailed for preparing material for Requirement 8 (opening packages, and distributing apportionate supplies) &#8212;should be given their examinations in Requirements 6 and 7, under the same rules as the test for the first patrol in these requirements. When the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>of the first patrol have finished in the trial test of Requirement 8, they should be given a chance to play a game of &quot; HatBall&quot; or one of their own choice; and second patrol, finished with Requirements 6 and 7, should then continue with Requirement 8, in the way already outlined, and the third patrol &#8212; those detailed to lay out requirements for the compass games <span class="gstxt_sub">:</span>&#8212; should be given their chance with Requirements 6 and 7. As soon as the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>of one patrol finish with the two tests, they should begin with a game, and as each of the other patrols finish, they, too, should join in the game.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>ments 6, 7, and 8, and the examiner and Scout Masters have made an examination of the cooked<span class='gtxt_body'>
products of Requirement 8 to test the thoroughness in cooking, then &quot;Compass Point&quot; game should be started, with thirty-two points. Every mistake made in calling points should be noted, and applicable grading made therefor. In addition each Scout should be called aside separately, some time during the course of the game, and bidden to repeat the sixteen principal compass points in their due order. This will constitute the trial of Requirement 10.</span></p>

Send Scout No. 2 out with similar instructions to send message to point 1 and receive message from point 3. Scout No. 3 with message for point 2 and to receive message from point 4. Scout No. 4 to send message to point 3 and receive message from point 1, etc. <i>Each Scout should be given a different message separately and secretly, and the points should be far enough away in opposite directions to preclude any other sort of communication than code signaling, and yet in plain reading view of each other. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Send several <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>out to collect information regarding movements of people, or any particular occurrences in different parts of town.</p>

Information from people living in the neighborhood is fairly reliable as to presence and location of springs, sources of streams, contaminating influences of lakes, streams, and wells, and the purity of the waters from each of these sources for drinking purposes.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>4. All garbage should be kept in a covered can or pail </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>and disposed of before decomposition takes place. Upon the break up of such a short time camp it should be buried in the ground, and covered over with several inches of earth. In longer time camps, the garbage should be so buried every one or two days. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. <i>Cleanliness should be insisted upon. Everybody </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>should be taught the value of good and safe sanitation and encouraged to cooperate to make sanitary rules actionable. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>6. The camp-site should be chosen, if possible, near a </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>place suitable for swimming, and in such a favored locality, proper arrangements should be provided for the swim or bath.

<i>period of time and providing for &quot;something doing &quot; during each part of the day.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>FRIDAY AFTERNOON OR 1ST DAY.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. At the appointed time for the start march out to the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>camping grounds in Patrol formation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Arrived at the camp, have the tents pitched by Patrol</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>team work in an orderly arrangement. <i>For these short-term camps the kind of tents for use would of course differ in different localities and at the option of the Scout Master. Ordinarily the leantos should prove ample, but in all cases provisions should be made for protection against rain both in selection of the tent and their erection. Tents should accommodate at least four </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>each; there should be with each such half patrol, a Patrol leader or Assistant Patrol Leader. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. When the tents have been pitched satisfactorily, pro</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ceed to have the beds prepared. (See suggestion 3, Program XVIII. And also see the articles on bedding in the Boys&#39; Handbook.) Also have poles fixed for the raising of the American flag, the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout emblem, and the Patrol insignia.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Prepare Supper. <i>Local geographical conditions will </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>suggest or demand a variety of dishes, and the sort of menu served at this first supper, of course, will depend upon your selection of food stuffs, cooking accommodations, etc. There should be plenty of milk to drink, and good bread and butter. Cake and sweets or fancy dishes are not necessary, and in such a short-term camp, are not expected. The bill of fare should be elastic to meet local and geographical and weather demands; your judgment of such local conditions zvill be all that is necessary for suggestive selections. Weather conditions will demand warm food when the weather is cold or rainy and cold dishes, as a rule, when the days are warm. Also the nature of the food will depend upon the location of the </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>troop,</i>&#8212; <i>in the Southern States, or in the North, in the East, or in the West, etc. For suggested menus for overnight and week end camps, see the Boys&#39; Handbook. </i>Take plenty of time for the eating of the meal. Encourage wholesome conversation and natural pleasantry, but discountenance any signs of ungentlemanly - conduct or &quot;rough house.&quot; 5. After supper, have a clean up of camp, dishwashing, removal of supper remains, etc. Then call the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>to &quot;Attention,&quot; and give out camp duty assignments. <i>For such a short-term camp these camp Committees should be chosen to serve permanently during the term length of the camp, and some means of creating a desire or honor to serve on some such Committee should be engendered or developed by the Scout Master. With this purpose in view the following plan has been suggested: Provide four committees for purposes such as Sanitation, Policing, Wood-gathering, and Campcleaning. The duties of the Sanitary Committee will consist of looking after the proper disposal of garbage, disinfection, care of latrine, etc.; the Policing Committee will see to proper obedience of camp rules, to getting water for cooking purposes, to picking up and disposing of all papers and trash about camp, the raising and lowering of the flags, etc.; the Camp Cleaners will prepare vegetables for cooking, wash and dry dishes, pot and pans, clean up around the cooking fires, clean the boats, if any are to be used; and the Wood Gatherers will provide wood for the camp-fires, gather fire-wood for cooking, build and light the camp-fire, etc. Have the assembled </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>elect the four leaders from among the members of the Troop by popular vote. Then have each leader, except the Chief Camp Cleaner, at this same meeting choose four other </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>to serve with him. And have it understood that Chief Camp Cleaner&#39;s committee will consist of the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>found guilty of misbehavior, breaking of camp rules, rowdyism, etc. </i></span></p>

Give instructions in the methods of cooking one or two articles as those given for Requirement 6 (F. C. S.). Also give instruction in the use of cooking fires, construction of fire places, etc. <i>For Information see Boys&#39; Handbook. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>7. After the dishes have been cleaned off and washed,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>new firewood brought in, and any other little duty attended to, have a half-hour of absolute rest, during which it might be advisable to give advanced instruction in First Aid, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>8. 1:45 p. <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>M. </span>Have a number of inter-patrol contests</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>planned for to take up the afternoon hours, such as lassoing, tomahawk throwing, bandaging, firelighting, tent raising, signaling, archery, tug-ofwar, running, tilting, jumping, First Aid drills, etc. Or else give such time to some good outdoor games, such as &quot;lion hunting,&quot; &quot;hostile spy,&quot; &quot;man-hunt,&quot; &quot;flag-raiding,&quot; &quot;deer hunt,&quot; &quot;bear hunt,&quot; etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>9. 4:00 p. <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>M. </span>If there are swimming facilities near the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>camp, a half hour should be given at this time to swimming instruction, water games, etc. <i>In such case, of course extra precautions should be taken to secure the best means of safety to the different </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts, </i></span><i>such as having watchers on the bank or in boats, a life-saving crew organized among the best swimmers, etc. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>This should be an evening meeting, and preparation made therefor at Headquarters with all the exercise materials ready for Scout drills in first aid, signal practice, and patrol formation, as well as games. Contests should be given at this meeting to enliven the boys, and quicken the general interest, provision therefor being made partly by announcement at the last meeting. It would also be well to have a list of the indoor contests posted, or given out at the last meeting as suggested, so that the boys could practice up a bit. These contests might be carried on individually, by choosing sides, or by patrols, and records or score-cards of simple material should be provided for the occasion. It would be best too to have this meeting on a night when no clouds are in the sky, and all the stars are out, so that the Scout could study the heavenly constellations as part of the evening exercises. If this is decided on, either you should prepare yourself sufficiently to point out several of the better known constellations, stars of the greater magnitude, planets, &quot;Milky Way,&quot; &quot; North Star,&quot; etc., or else get someone to be with you for the evening, who does understand a bit about Astronomy, and who might act also as a Contest Judge for the practice trials. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1. Open the meeting with roll call and flag salute, asking each Scout as his name is called to answer by giv<span class='gtxt_body'>ing his Patrol Call, and immediately thereafter to salute the flag.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>5. Have the knot-tying contest. <i>In counting points it </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>is suggested that you count </i>5 <i>for first place in any one contest, </i>j <i>for second place, and 1 for third place. </i>In this contest such counts are suggested as:&#8212; (1) largest number of knots; (2) most skill and ease in tying; (3) fastest time in tying certain knots of choice, or in completing all knots, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>6. Have the lassoing contest. Counts: Best three at</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>tempts out of five; method of throwing, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>7. While these two contests are going on, and especially</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>while awaiting results of the lassoing contest, it would be interesting to have a tomahawk throwing contest. <i>For this a large upright board target should be provided and caution should be used not to stand too far away at first. If your target is not wide enough to take all the blows&#39;, this might prove too destructive for inside practice, but it will always prove an interesting outdoor event. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>8. Call for volunteers to answer queries as to knowledge</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>of First Aid,&#8212; Counts: general knowledge; largest number of questions answered, etc. <i>It would not be wise to have too many, lest the boys grow weary, but certainly since this is so vital a subject and so absolutely necessary in Scoutcraft, that at least as large a number of questions should be asked as will demonstrate the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts&#39; </i></span><i>general knowledge, and emphasise in their minds the importance of the subject. </i>The following general questions are suggested: &#176; &#176;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>The greater part of a Saturday should be given to this meeting, and you should have given some special attention towards arrangements and plans therefor. It is suggested that some few field events be added to the day&#39;s program other than those mentioned and explained in the Boys&#39; Handbook,</i>&#8212; <i>events such as short races, spear or javelin throwing, high jump and broad jump, Indian war dances, etc. If there is any racing of whatever sort planned for, care should be taken that such </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>who want to run are in such healthy condition that a short sprint or other similar exercise will not be harmful. Each Scout should be requested to bring his own food supply along, and his individual kit for preparing the same if he has it. In the sport events materials should be arranged for in plenty of time ahead,</i>&#8212;<i>such as wig-wag flags, tent paraphernalia, poles for high jumping (if planned for), javelins or spears, bows and arrow&#39;s for archery contest, lassos, etc. The counts should be the same as arranged for in Program XXXI and the same general rules and regulations observed. The field should be in open and rather Hat ground, and not too far away from your Scout Headquarters, so that materials can easily be taken to and from the field. But it would be best to select your field as much in the country as possible. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>It is presumed that by this time all the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>enrolled in your troop have a full outfit of uniform, mess-kits, etc., ax given in the appendix of the Boys&#39; Handbook. (See pages </i>359-368, <i>inclusive). The Ax (page </i>360) <i>will do excellently as a tomahawk. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1. Having arrived on the grounds or field, start the program with an assembly and short talk outlining</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA192'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the purpose of the day&#39;s exercises, the rules and regulations to be followed, and an outline of events in their approximate order.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Devote a short time to troop drill and instruction.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Start the regular program of sports with a lasso</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>contest. Use a tree stump or post at suitable distance, and also a moving Scout.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Then have a tomahawk contest at 20, 40 and 50 foot</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>spaces. Use a tree stump or board target; <i>never </i>use a living, growing tree.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Have a First Aid contest by team work in resuscita</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>tion drill,&#8212; for artificial respiration, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. Have a First Aid contest by team work in a stretcher</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>drill.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. Next have a quarter-mile run open to all whom it is</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>perfectly safe to let race.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. Have a javelin or asegai contest. <i>In making these </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>spears or javelins some harder wood should be used and sharpened to a point on one end so that when thrown it will stick into the ground. These spears should be about eight feet in length, and slender and light, as in the regulation spear in use in college field-sports. They may even be pointed with an iron head to lend weight to the point. Almost any encyclopedia will give a fair description of such a light spear. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>9. Now have a half hour rest. <i>The boys will need such </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>a rest both because of the previous exercises, and of the other events still to come. But care should be taken in having the rest, that the boys do not catch cold because of cooling off too rapidly or in the wrong place. Care should always be taken to so arrange the events that health and the bodily interests of your </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>shall always be best secured. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>10. During this rest or immediately thereafter it would</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>be a very good time to have the fire-lighting and waterboiling contest. <i>Each competitor should gather his own wood (if in a woodless field, such materials should be furnished)</i>, <i>light his fire using not more than two matches, carry his water in a can provided by himself, which should contain as nearly a quart as possible. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>11. When the fires are built, dinner should be prepared,<span class='gtxt_body'>
scout style. <i>Each Scout should provide and prepare his own food; but all the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>scouts </i></span><i>should plan to eat together. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>13. Now have a fire making contest by rubbing sticks to-1</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>gether. <i>(For instructions, see B. H. pages </i>70-75).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>14. Next have a tent raising contest by team work, pro</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Deploy the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>advantageously, and have the trials consist of taking and receiving messages from your central station. Test out both code systems so far made use of.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>16. If accommodations and weather will permit it would be well to have a swimming contest for those who know how to swim. <i>Great care however should be taken in case of this event, and every precaution taken against any accident. Do not allow the boys to stay in the water longer than a half-hour. </i>If the swimming contest is impossible, have in its stead a 100-yard dash, open for all with exceptions as in the quarter-mile race. 17. As a rest after the last event it would be best to have the archery contest. // <i>the boys have not already been instructed in the use of bows and arrows and the method of making them (see B. H. page </i>7581), <i>their use now will be an incentive towards an awakening interest in this fine sport. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>First Aid Practice &#8212; Elementary Astronomy</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This evening&#39;s meeting should be given over to First Aid practice during the first part of the evening, if the sky is clear enough to study the stars, but if the sky is overcast with clouds, a few games should be interspersed between part of the First Aid practice, and the latter work receive fairly concentrated attention during the whole evening. In case the stars can be studied, and it is clear enough to pick out the different principal constellations, the boys will need no intervening exercise, but should find plenty in this skystudy to create and hold the interest. A good book for the boys to read, if so interested, and excellent for the use of the Scout Master is &quot; Starland&quot; by Robert S. Ball,</i>&#8212; <i>a look of exceptional suggestions and important information set forth in a simple, clearly defined manner,</i>&#8212; <i>just the thing in fact, for the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>boy. </i></span><i>For more advanced information for the Scout Master and as an aid in constellation study see J. D. Steele&#39;s &quot;Popular Astronomy!&#39; especially Part III, and &quot;Astronomy with the Naked Eye&quot; by Garrett P. Serviss. If circumstances permit a study of the stars, one or two telescopes or field-glasses should be borrowed to aid the eye in seeing further and clearer and enlarging the planets; a telescope, though, is not necessary for first study,</i>&#8212; <i>only an excellent help. In the larger cities, large tripod telescopes are usually found on street-corners or in park squares, whose owners charge only five or ten cents for a look at the planets and the moon. Tell the boys of this, so that they may take advantage of the opportunity, should their interest be aroused. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>In preparation for First Aid practice, all bandages and appliances should be at hand for demonstration instruction and practice in all the different First Aid drills and methods. It might also be a good thing to have a speaker for this meeting, a physician, surgeon, or nurse to talk on some physiological subject,such as &quot; The Bones,&quot; &quot; Health,&quot; &quot; The Body in Action,&quot; &quot; The Nervous System,&quot; &quot; Mind and Body,&quot; etc. Or it might be a good suggestion, also, to get some authority or student of astronomy to help out in the star-study. </i></p>

<a class='page'  id='PA199'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1. Begin the meeting<span class="gstxt_sup">&#8226;</span> with a few words outlining the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>program of the evening, or with a short yell practice, or roll call with Patrol call answers, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>2. Have a few of the regular First Aid drills by assign</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ment, such as stretcher drill, head bandage, arm bandage with splints, leg with splints, collar bone, resuscitation drill, etc. (Only roller bandages should be used.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>3. If a speaker has been arranged for as suggested, have</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the talk at this time. <i>This should be well understood to be brief,</i>&#8212; <i>not more than ten minutes&#39; duration,</i>&#8212; <i>and right to the point. </i>After the talk, allow a few extra minutes in which the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>may ask questions, if interested.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>4. Go over the treatment for accidents and emergencies</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>as outlined in the Boys&#39; Handbook, and explain all hazy points. Have the boys tell by assignment or voluntarily what to do for treatment of the most common emergencies, such as cuts, bruises, sprains, burns, eye troubles, toothaches, poisons, dog bites, snake bites, insect stings, fits, freezing, etc. <i>Two most complete and excellent small books on First Aid for Scout Masters and </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>alike, replete with explanations, illustrations, and descriptions are &quot;Emergencies&quot; by Charlotte V. Gulick (Ginn &amp; Co., </i>1909), <i>and &quot;Emergency Notes&quot; by G. R. Butler, M. D. (Funk &amp; Wagnall Co., </i>1889). <i>A more complete work on the same subject, though of same size, is &quot;Johnson&#39;s First Aid Manual, 4th edition (paper covered, Johnson &amp; Johnson, </i>1909).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>5. If there is to be no star-study this evening, close the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>meeting with, or else intersperse before suggestion 4, a few suitable indoor Scout games. End the meeting with announcements and the Scout Yells.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>6. If it is clear enough for star study, the announce</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ments should be made for the next meeting, and then all should adjourn to some suitable open place where the astronomy study should begin. If telescopes have been procured, it would be best to have at hand some simple affair to serve as a rest for the glasses so that they may be held as steadily as possible. From charts pick out the positions of as<span class='gtxt_body'>
many of the planets as can be seen, and have all the boys understand the difference between the planets and the stars proper. Outline simply the main ideas of the planetary or Copernican theory of evolution, and briefly explain shooting stars, meteors, comets, nebula, etc. Tell about the different moons, the method of measuring star distances, the coldness of the earth&#39;s moon surface, the reason for eclipses, and reason for changes of the seasons, etc. Tell about sun spots, rotation, revolution, &quot;Milky Way,&quot; and constellations; and answer as many of the interested questions as possible. Pick out the main constellations of the month. <i>These can be learned usually from students of astronomy, are outlined in the book by Mr. G. P. Serviss, or will be sent free of charge to any Scout Master, by application to Headquarters, Publishing Department. </i>7. Adjourn the meeting with the Scout Yells and Patrol Calls, or with some of the old well-known songs.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This special meeting has been suggested because of the real need of cooking practice in the open under careful leadership and instruction. In this case as much time as possible should be given to the proper trials of this requirement, trying the preparation of every article.</i>. <i>This should be out in the open in the woods or fields, and all materials should be made ready beforehand, each Scout packing along his own rations and kit.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Get out into the open, and divide the troop into</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>squads of two for the cooking practice.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>order to ascertain from the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>themselves just what things to consider, it might be best to ask each Scout to hand in before the meeting a list of the points which are not quite clear to him, so that the needed instruction can be given collectively or individually, or else to have a general question quiz. Some of the First Aid information should be reviewed, and also nature observation of living things and starland, and topography or map making. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>A system of efficiency percentages is also a good subject to introduce at this time. It will help out in the final tests, and may prove of great interest to the boys in their desire to become best versed in Scout principles and proficient in Scout activities. Kept individually or by patrol it will also serve as an excellent record system for reference use by </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts, </i></span><i>Scout Masters and other officers, and by parents. Quite a number of Scout Masters already have some sort of honor system or efficiency records, such as this scheme proposes and includes, and the majority are having exceptional success with the idea. Such a record can be kept in a great number of ways, ranging all the way from simple unit marks to such a system as used in baseball records of league standings, batting averages, etc. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Of course too much time should not be taken up with continual attention to the necessary instruction. A good start, fifteen or twenty minutes of concentrated attention with persistent effort, a little play, and a bit more of work with mechanical action or movement, a closing with a feeling of free spirit and fellowship, a creation of enthusiasm, a b1nd1ng of ties toward one another and to the organization,</i>&#8212; <i>that should always be the general plan and the purpose of every meeting with boys.

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Hon should be given. Of course there are some parts of the country where there are no facilities for such sport, e1ther natural or artificial, but the majority of American boys have a chance of learning to swim at some time or another during the year. As a substitute plan for this meeting in place of swimming instruction, the troop might get out into the fields for a signal practice, have an athletic contest under your instruction in proper methods, or a visit might be taken to some interesting place in the city or country. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>In case swimming is to be the purpose of this meeting, it would be best to have along several older fellows for the occasion, to give instruction in the proper methods and in water games, and also to provide for plenty of protection against accidents. If the boys care to do so, it would be a good stunt for the whole troop to visit the nearest baths or natatorium for this afternoon swim. The price is very reasonable in most places, safety is provided for, and care is usually taken that the water is of the right temperature for the time of the year. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Quite a number of boys will have opportunity to learn swimming only at salt-water baths or at the ocean beaches. Salt-water swimming is exhilarating and excellent, but because of the difference in the floating qualities of the waters, boys are better able to cope with every sort of water accident, if they have first learned to swim in fresh water. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>As much instruction should be given at this meeting as possible. Probably the majority of the boys who can already szvim only know one or two strokes at the most, while for safety and efficiency in saving others they will have need of knowing all different strokes,</i>&#8212; <i>such as side-stroke, backstroke, breast-stroke, trudgeon, crawl, etc. There are three ways of using the legs, and four or five ways of using the arms; and any ingenious person can invent from these movements almost any number of combination strokes. The proper methods of floating and diving might also be demons strated, as well as the several methods of helping out in water accidents. (See B. H., pp. </i>279-288.)</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>The evening business meeting should be arranged for as on previous occasions, and carried out according to plan of meeting adopted in the troop by-laws before the real business of the meeting begins. It might be arranged to obtain a speaker to talk on some interesting subject. If this is done, it should be by the actions of the entertainment committee upon some topic agreed upon by them. This committee might also arrange for such other entertainment as seems advisable and permissible by the Scout Master. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Discussion of troop finances by the Scout Master and </i><span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>troop members should be in order at this meeting, and means and plans for carrying on the scout work by interesting program suggestions, between the business meeting and the next, when a new series of program activities can be arranged for and suggested. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>This meeting should be planned to create rivalry between the patrols and promote individual efficiency in the different Scout attainments. Some point system should be outlined and adopted, giving awards for each event, but all points should be accredited to the whole patrol rather than to individual </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>of the patrols. Some award, such as a Scout banner, or especially designed patrol Hag, or some other insignia, should be given to the patrol winning the highest number of points, the winners to hold the trophy for a certain length of time, when a new contest will decide the next holder of the honor, or especial banner or insignia. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Athletics should not enter into this contest, except in a minor way and only as applied in regular scouting. Proficiency in general Scoutcraft should receive highest recognition, and the patrol of younger boys should receive the same attention and same chance as patrols of older fellows. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>For suggested events for winning of points see Chapter VI of the Scout Master&#39;s Manual. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Hold the meeting with such suggested order of events as given in Program XLIV, for inter-troop contest or troop demonstrations. Tardiness and attendance should also be marked down to the credit or loss of the patrol, when such award has been determined upon by the troop. There will also be any number of other points for contest, which will prove adaptable, and occur to the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>or Scout Master in planning for such a contest. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>MANUAL OF MARCHING FOR <span class="gstxt_hlt">BOY SCOUTS </span>OF AMERICA *</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>By </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Dr. </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Paul </span>C. <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Ph1ll1ps </span><br/>    of Amherst, Mass. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Preliminary note. For the proper handling of large groups of boys the requisites are: 1, A simple but definite drill manual and 2, a corps of Scout Masters who not only thoroughly understand it but can teach it and use it practically. Drills and marching are valuable, because of the qualities they develop in the individual <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>such as obedience to command, mental and physical alertness and a good carriage. The boys must know how to carry out the few orders required, must be obedient to command, prompt and must maintain a good carriage.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Care must be taken, however, not to limit the operations of the boys to those movements for which these orders are given. The Scout Master should remember that the manual of drill is but a means to an end, that the temporary obedience to command required is only to enable them to do larger things in the line of their physical and mental development. The obedience is not a surrender of individuality. It should not end in suppression but expression.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Divisions. For convenience in handling, the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>will be grouped naturally into <i>patrols, </i>of say seven boys in</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> <i>It is sometimes necessary to join with others on special occasions in drills and parades although parading for public show or self glory should in general be discouraged. Even in connection with patriotic celebrations such as Decoration Day and the Fourth of July, it might be more helpful to have troops of </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>organise to render </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>practical </i></span><i>service by furnishing the marchers with water, or having the </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>organize for First Aid work rather than to march in the parade itself. The </i><span class="gstxt_hlt"><i>Scouts </i></span><i>of old rarely made a show of themselves. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Front! On this order each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>except the one who did not turn his head should turn his head sharply back to the front.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Turns. These are always either quarter turns or half turns.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Right, Turn. On this order each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should turn on his heels one-quarter of the way round to the right. Left, turn done to the left.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Right, About, Turn (or L.). On this order each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should turn on his heels, toward the right, half way around, so that he is facing in the opposite direction.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Count Fours. On this order the boys should count off fours beginning at the right (or left if they closed up to left). Each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>when counting should turn his face to the one who is to count next and immediately turn it back to the front.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Forward, March. On the order &quot;march,&quot; all the boys indicated should step forward promptly with the left foot about twenty-four inches, and continue marching until some other order is given.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Short Step. On this order all the boys should shorten step to about twelve inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Mark Time, March. On this order each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should raise his feet, beginning with the right foot, one after the other as if marching but should not leave his place.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Halt! On this order, given on the march, when one foot strikes the ground, one step should be taken and then the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should stop with feet together.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Backward, March. On this order all the boys indicated should march backward, while facing the front, by taking short steps with knees only slightly bent. Seldom given when in single file.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Note. In marching in single file the boys should be directly behind one another and the distance apart not more than eighteen inches. This is a lock step. In double file (&quot; by twos &quot;) the distance apart is three feet and in fours about six feet.</p>

When marching in a double column all the boys numbered 1 and 2 shorten step a little and the boys numbered 3 and 4 lengthen step a little, turning a little to the right (or left) until along side of the numbers 1 and 2 when all take full step again. Note. Form fours may be done directly from single file</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>without first forming twos. Right by Twos, March. Given on the march in column of fours. The numbers 1 and 2 lengthen step and the 3&#39;s and 4&#39;s shorten step falling in behind the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>1&#39;s </span>and 2&#39;s.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Right by File, March. Given on the march in column of twos. The numbers 1 and 3 lengthen step and the numbers 2 and 4 shorten step, falling in behind.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Note. Right by file may be given from column of fours, when 2, 3 and 4 fall into file behind number 1. Column Right, March (or L.). When marching&#39; in single file, by twos or by fours on the order &quot;march,&quot; the head of the column should turn to the right at right angles to the former direction, or left if so indicated. If this order is given when the men are in a column of fours, the four at the head of the column should turn to the right (or left). The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>on the right acting as a pivot and the other three turning on him until they are at right angles to the former line of march when they should march straight ahead again. When the other fours have reached the spot where the first four turned they should turn in the same way.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fours Right, March. On this order, given from a halt or while on the march in a column of fours, the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>on the right of each four acts as a pivot while the others turn, or wheel, on him through a quarter of a circle. If the distances between the fours were correct this will bring the fours into one line, when they halt, if they started from a halt, or march forward, closing up toward the right, if they were on the march.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If fours right is given when the boys are in line, at halt or on the march, the number 1&#39;s act as pivots until the 2&#39;s, 3&#39;s and 4&#39;s have wheeled through a quarter turn to the right when they halt or march off in column of fours.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Distances. </i>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>in this drill should be 8&#39;-6&quot; apart from side to side and 8&#39; apart from front to rear. Any of the ordinary methods for opening ranks may be used to get them into this arrangement.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>Posture. </i>It is important that the correct posture be taken in this drill that the desired physical effect may be produced. Done properly, i. e., correctly and with sufficient energy, the movements will develop markedly the muscles of the shoulders, waist and legs and help to &quot;set up&quot; the boys. They are designed also to aid digestion.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Frequently during the summer months, it will be found desirable to have all of the troops of a town or city join. in a one day outing. During the day a program of field events may be carried through which will prove generally interesting to the boys. Such &quot; get together&quot; meetings are<span class='gtxt_body'>
very helpful as a means of getting boys acquainted with <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>of other troops and giving them some idea of what other boys are doing. It broadens the boys&#39; vision of the movement and tends to develop the fraternal spirit. Friendly rivalry in Scout activities may be judiciously used as a further incentive to proficiency in Scoutcraft.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The success of such an event will largely depend upon the amount of work done by the &quot; Committee on Arrangements&quot; prior to the field event in planning for it. This committee may be made up of from three to five Scout Masters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The committee should select a site for the outing. This ought to be located near some stream, on a piece of ground well surrounded by trees and yet open enough to afford good camping and an opportunity to conduct Scout events.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In every case where it is practicable for the Scout Master or his assistant to take his troop into camp on Friday evening, it is desirable that he do so. Where the Scout Master finds this impossible, however, he should take his troop to the camp ground on Saturday morning.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Each troop on arrival at camp should select the best available site for its tents; each patrol selecting its own location, pitching its own tent, and otherwise making all camp arrangements as though planning for a permanent camp.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Regulations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Upon reaching the grounds Scout Masters and Patrol Leaders will report at Headquarters for instructions. The following bugle calls will be used:</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Officers&#39; Call &#8212; Scout Masters report immediately at Headquarters.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the contest at the call of &quot;Assembly,&quot; all troops assemble at the edge of the parade ground.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The conduct of the troops will be under inspection from the time they reach the field until they break camp.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It should be needless to remind Scout Masters that, in a broader way, the conduct of each troop as it passes through the city will be under the inspection of the public.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Troop Age.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America plan to get hold of every American <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>to improve his general interest in life through Scouting, to weld manly principles into his character, and to make him, through personal and advisory development, fully competent, efficient and cooperative. Scouting is a movement designed to help the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>during the adolescent period of life, so because the greater majority of boys pass through the functional manhood changes between twelve and eighteen years, such limiting ages were adopted in Scouting, and are most carefully enforced.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Older <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A Scout over eighteen may continue his Scouting whenever he chooses, and many do continue as Assistant Scout Masters when they have had previous requisite training. But it is not the intention of the Movement to interest and enroll lads over eighteen. Their wants and interests are usually adequately provided for by the numerous adult organizations, clubs and societies.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Younger <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Some boys develop earlier than others so that physical equals may range in years from 12 to 14, but the greater mass of boys begin to pass through .the adolescent period between 12 and 13 years of age. To insure stability, and guard against the evils of admitting the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who is too young, the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America have adopted the age of 12 years as the lowest age of Scout admissions and make of it a rigidly enforced rule of admission.</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>mixed ages. A majority of little fellows will often drive out the older <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>so that the problem of grouping becomes very important in troop management. There is as little toleration for the younger <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>on the part of the older fellow as there is for the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>of eighteen or nineteen by grown men.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>But in providing for a troop of all ages in Scouting, the age grouping should receive recognition in the formation of patrols. In this case variety of ages is detrimental. For instance the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>of twelve should not be in the same group with the seventeen-year-old <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>In almost everything the interests of the younger <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>have no attraction for the older fellow. For this reason it is best to group the boys of similar ages in patrols.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Problem of Grading by Age.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>During the adolescent changes, however, the chonological and physiological ages seldom definitely agree. Often the youngster who is chronologically fourteen may be physiologically ten or sixteen or else ranging somewhere between. For this reason it is absolutely impossible to scientifically grade the Tenderfoot and other degrees of Scouting by age. Some boys mature much more rapidly than others, and because of this a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>should not be held back in the securing of his degree. To hold any <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>back by any artificial limits when he possesses the ability to meet the requirements, is a crime against the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>He should be encouraged to pass the requirements as quickly as possible, and thoroughness should be insisted upon by the Scout Master and the Court of Honor. There are incentives among the scout activities, in the winning of merit badges, carrying on community Scouting, and in leadership development, to hold the interest of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>after he has become a First Class Scout; and as the Movement grows older, more interest-holding specialties will undoubtedly be developed. No <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will be attracted by any grade or degree, if it fails to arouse his interest. There is a great need of graded work, but this should be provided for by the orderly progressive plan which the Scout Master himself works out as he studies the need of each individual <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Starting - - The Wrong and the Right Way.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The wrong way to start a patrol or troop of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>is to make an announcement in some newspaper or from the</p>

This is a very common mistake, and usually results in a large percentage of the boys who join under such, conditions, dropping out later on. The right way to start Scouting is to select seven or eight of the leading boys of the community, preferably between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, and beginning with this small group as a patrol, gradually to increase the</p>

The most successful troop is the one which achieves success with a small nucleus first, and develops in size and progress of Scouting as success continues. At the beginning it is best to present to the boys a full explanation of the scope and purpose of Scouting and its meaning, a personal survey of the Handbook activities, a careful reading of the Scout Oath and Scout Law, a clear idea of the &quot;Daily Good Turn,&quot; and possibly a consideration of suggested by-laws and an initiation form, which, if used, should be simple and impressive. How much of parliamentary practices to use will depend largely on the choice of the Scout Master.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Patrol Organization.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Having properly instructed the members of the new troop the next step is to perfect the patrol organization. The necessary.thing in the formation of the patrol is the appointment or election of a patrol leader and an assistant patrol leader. In some cases the Scout Master will find it necessary, in order to maintain his authority among the troop members, to dictate the election of or to personally appoint the patrol and assistant patrol leaders; but the best way, perhaps, is to let the boys appoint or elect the1r own leaders. The patrol formation is directly based upon the gang idea, and is in reality an organized gang under <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>leadership and adult supervision, instead of an unorganized gang under <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>leadership and no other direction. In the unorganized gang there is always a natural leader in command, and this <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will assert his ability and power for leadership in whatever group of boys he may be. For this reason it is better for the boys to elect their own leaders as this natural leader-type is most likely to be selected by them. Otherwise, if another sort of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is appointed or selected as leader, the chances are that the natural leader of the group will either oust the other fellow or break up the patrol. The problem of the selection of patrol leaders, whether by official or dictatorial appointment, by proficiency in Scouting, by Scout rank, or by the self-government election of the group, must necessarily be left to the consideration of the individual Scout Master and the needs of the occasion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Patrol Meetings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The patrol leader usually presides at all patrol meetings and the assistant patrol leader acts as secretary. The different duties of the patrol officers should be prescribed in - the troop constitution and by-laws, which should be adopted by each troop to provide for all group needs. The patrol should meet in business session at regularly prearranged intervals to conduct its own affairs, as differen<span class='gtxt_body'>tiated from troop affairs, or, if, as at first, forming the nucleus of the future troop. All rules and regulations for the governing of patrols should be formulated by the patrol members, and the punishments for infringements should also be meted out by them (subject to the Scout Master&#39;s supervision). The patrol meeting should be orderly and conducted by parliamentary rules, and a record of everything should be kept. Later when the troop has been formed, or where the troop is already existent, there should be a regular troop constitution and by-laws which should cover and outline patrol activities, meetings, and special deliberations, etc.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Troop Meetings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At a troop meeting the senior patrol leader usually presides unless otherwise provided for by the constitution and by-laws which the troop members should adopt. The patrol leader ranking second in order of seniority usually acts as secretary, and the third patrol leader in point of service as treasurer. The troop should make his own rules, and as in the case of patrol meetings the members should be orderly in their meeting and governed by parliamentary rulings. In the troop meeting unless otherwise provided for the patrols sit separately, the senior patrol on the right, the second on the left, and so on, with the youngest or last formed in the center. The Scout Master and the Assistant Scout Master sit beside the presiding patrol leader. While in the field, or on the march, the senior patrol usually leads with the others following in order of the length of their service</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Troop Constitution and By-Laws.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By all means some form of constitution and by-laws should be adopted by each troop, or some ritual used for all business meetings. The following constitution and bylaws are given as suggestions. This has been made rather more complete than necessary so as to cover all points. Each Scout Master and troop of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>in formulating their own constitution and by-laws should find this suggested form of value as a model, but should select such of it, or make such changes, as seem best fitted for their local needs. It should be said as a word of caution that Scout troops and patrols are not secret societies, and the adopted ritual should be kept as simple as possible.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Chivalry should have its inception in the patrol and troop. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>should under no circumstances call their Scout Master or the Assistant Scout Master by their first names; they should be addressed as Mr. Scout Master and Mr. Assistant Scout Master. The Patrol Leader and his assistant should be addressed as Patrol Leader <i>(Morris)</i>, and Assistant Patrol Leader <i>(Hewitt). </i>In receiving an order<span class='gtxt_body'>
from a Scout Master or Assistant Scout Master, the Scout, should answer, &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; or &quot;No, sir,&quot; as the case demands, and the ordinary rules of courtesy should be observed at all times. In addressing the chair or an officer a Scout should always salute before doing so. Every troop should possess a United States Flag, and each Scout should come to the salute as he passes the national colors, and observe all other respects due to the flag.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>AT THE TRAINING CAMP FOR SCOUT MASTERS AT SILVER BAY, NEW YORK, DURING THE SUMMER OF IQI2</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>a sum of five cents a week per member for the expenses of the patrol. In such case the Scout Master should use a great deal of judgment in the matter and should prevent the boys from such a thing, if there is a single <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the patrol upon whom the weekly tax would work a hardship. None of the money put into the patrol treasury should be used for the purchase of individual equipment for the boys. One of the cardinal principles of the movement is that each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>shall earn his own uniform and equipment. Patrol funds therefore should be used for patrol expenses. In a few places of the country there are troops or patrols which have set a pace by instituting a treasury into which the boys are permitted to pay small amounts of money which is to be paid out for charitable purposes only.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA267'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Troop moneys should be used in the same way as patrol funds &#8212; for general troop equipment. The matter of dues is always important and should always receive due consideration so as not to entail any hardship upon any <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>Usually both the troop and the patrol will elect its own treasury officer who will have care of the common funds. However any temptation for such a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to go astray should not be permitted by the Scout Master, and while trust should be given to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>there should be a general rule providing that all moneys of the troop or patrol should be carefully deposited in a local bank, and the account opened in the patrol&#39;s or troop&#39;s name. Where this is not possible the Scout Master should be the bank receiving the funds, giving the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>treasurer receipts for all funds so deposited with him.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Troop Equipment.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There will always be a problem for the Scout Master to consider in the matter of Scout equipment and uniforms. The ordinary patrol and troop will be composed of the boys of all classes, and how to regulate the uniform and equipment under such conditions will always have to be settled by local needs and circumstances. It should be clearly understood, however, that while a uniform and equipment is a great help to patrol and troop activity it is not entirely essential to the success and progress.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>No matter whether the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is poor or well-to-do he should earn his own uniform and equipment by doing work at a reasonable wage, and it should be impressed upon him that he must work fairly and honestly &#8212; that he should not do some very small thing and receive a high rate of pay from parent or guardian,&#8212; but that his <span class="gstxt_hlt">wage </span>should be the reasonable wage. In this way the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>will obtain an idea of the working value of money. If each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>pays for his uniform and individual equipment, the problem will be largely solved whether the boys are rich or poor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Patrol Property.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is best to allow the patrol to have some property in common. Besides affording a lesson in cooperation, it furnishes a tie which will bind the members of the patrol together. Such equipment may consist of the patrol flag, tent, combination cooking outfit, first aid kit, and road maps, etc. Local needs will add many other articles to this list.<span class='gtxt_body'>
Troop Property.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA268'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In addition to the patrol equipment, as a means of tying the various patrols more closely together, it will probably be best to have some property owned by the entire troop. There may be a headquarters, a mess tent for field-work, and furniture and paraphernalia for the troop club room are naturally suggested as things for troop ownership. And of course there is also the troop flag. Where troops have their own or permanent headquarters, the Scout Master should encourage the different troop members to make their own stools, boxes, and other handy articles used at headquarters or in scouting. The property which will be accumulated by the troop will vary in quantity and kind as the life of the troop extends itself, and such features as a library, a natural history museum, a reading room, etc., might be added.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Where the boys show ability or liking for certain trades or mechanical work the Scout Master should seek to tie them up to some expert or tradesman who will be willing to aid the boys in their desire for technical knowledge and experience, each in the work of his choice or adaptability.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Scout Examinations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Appointed dates should be set for examinations for the different Scout ranks and for merit badges. Such a course should prove more acceptable to the Scout Master and to Scout conditions, than to allow the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to take his examinations at any time he wishes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All examinations wherever there is a local council should be conducted by the Court of Honor and not by the Scout Master in charge of the troop. Where there is no Court of Honor, it is best to obtain the aid of another Scout Master or some other known man of the community to serve as such a court. Where the local Scout Master gives examinations to his own <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>there will always be charges of favoritism, and a general feeling of discontent will be engendered before very long under such conditions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It should also be the general rule that the Scout should make formal application for an examination. This besides impressing the Scout that the examination is a matter of consequence, will furnish a valuable record of the work accomplished by the various <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>The following blank is a suggestion for such an application form: &#8212;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If possible individual record systems should be kept showing the progress of each Scout, as well as records showing progress of patrols and troops. In some cities where point systems have been established detailed records are kept showing standing of each Scout, each patrol, and each troop in the individual inter-patrol and inter-troop contests. As suggestions for similar systems, models of Scout records, and in order to standardize as far as possible the different ideas originated, the following records and point systems have been compiled and are recommended to all the Scout Masters.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>One of the greatest incentives to Scouting in a troop or under a Local Council will be the independent troop or patrol competition which can be started and continued through definite periods of time. Scoring in these competitions should be on an individual basis, each Scout getting full credit for his accomplishments, each score being put to his credit, if in an inter-Scout contest in the patrol, or for the patrol or troop, if in case of an inter-patrol or inter-troop contest. Interest in the troop competition may be intensified by the Local Council or Scout Master putting up a trophy shield or cup, the trophy to be held by the winner until the close of the next competition. In this way the contest can be continued for three, six or twelve months.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Such contests between patrols in the same troop and also between all the different troops in the district has been very successfully carried out on the point-system basis as suggested by the contest outlined on pp. 269-274. Every Scout Commissioner and Scout Master will see the value in this suggestion, and will perhaps be able to add further to the point-system in order to make and create new stunts, new interest, and a renewal of good results.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Gernjanic Origin of Chivalry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To understand the conditions which gave origin to chivalry, one must delve into the realms of pre-mediseval history, and understand the characteristics of the early Germanic peoples. A conquering race, they were noted for their war-like spirit, love of adventure, thirst for glory, and devotion and esteem for women.<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> These tribal attributes formed the chrysalis from whence issued forth the ideas of chivalry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Ceremony of Manhood &#8212; Altruism.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Chivalry has been wholly altruistic even in its earliest conceptions.<span class="gstxt_sup">2</span> In its Very origin it had in it the element of service to others. The early German performed mighty deeds of valor and strove valiantly and heroically for his leader or king and for the protection of his women.<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span> His duty of service became in time a requisite of manhood&#39;s estate, and thus grew up the Germanic custom of solemnly arming the youth in the presence of the warriors, upon his assumption of the duties of manhood.<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> This impressive assumption of a man&#39;s obligations including the qualities of bravery, fidelity, and loyalty, was made the basis of knighthood.<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> and the whole ceremony with all it represented became that of chivalry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Chivalric Duties and Privileges &#8212; Influences.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Along with the development of knighthood and feudalism, there grew up a great body of duties and privileges,<span class='gtxt_body'>
essential requisites of the vassal in the service of his lord, and directly the outcome of the Germanic &quot;man-making&quot; ceremony.<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> Owing to their first material development to feudal usages and customs, with which chivalry had many relations, these duties and privileges were later taken over and altered by the Church to further its own control of society. Thenceforth the conception of knightly honor slowly grew up and with it the gradual union of chivalric principles with ethical ideals.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At the end of the 12th Century, chivalry was profoundly influenced by the popular romances of Arthur, Sir Galahad, Charlemagne, and other heroes.<span class="gstxt_sup">7</span> Manners became less brutal, men strove more to attain the ideal of service in life through honor and loyalty and righteousness, and a spirit of knight-errantry grew up. This was perhaps the greatest saving element of mediaeval history for from its influence arose the desire for the good, the ideal, and the altruistic spirit. This period of the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; was a harsh time, and chivalry with knight-errantry<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> came to make life a little more worth the living, and form the one bright spot of truth and fidelity in all the chaos of embryonic nation-building and petty warfare.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Decline of Chivalry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Chivalry was at its best in the 12th Century, but was rapidly declining in the 14th Century, and was thoroughly decadent in the 15th Century. Lastly the term chivalry came to be used in its present very general sense of &quot;courtesy&quot; and a gentlemanly service. It deteriorated from the plane of requisites of manhood qualifications to only the possibility of a man&#39;s ideals.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Chivalry gave to the world its greatest developments in early literature,<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> its most popular romances, and hero-tales. From its effects upon mankind it gave birth to the Crusades <span class="gstxt_sup">10</span> and later to the Renaissance.

<p class='gtxt_body'>directly traced to the influences of the ideals of chivalry.<span class="gstxt_sup">11</span> No wonder then, that its passing has left such a deep impression upon the building of civilization or the fashioning of man&#39;s inherited conceptions of fidelity, loyalty, honor and righteousness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>American Chivalry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>We trace the development of our conceptions of chivalric pr1nciples back through the vistas of European history, but we Americans have examples of greater worth and more profound impression in the tribal civilizations and of the Indians of our Continent and in the lives of our pioneer forefathers. The lives of each of these types of earlier Americans furnish us with numberless concrete examples of the practice of chivalric principles, the esteem for truth and loyalty, and the worth of right living.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Indian has too often been deeply wronged by the false portrayal of his character. In his life as a tribesman, unsullied by the vices of the white man, his was the highest type of the primitive ideal of clean living. He was a master of woodcraft, and clean, manly, heroic, self-controlled, reverent, and truthful. Indeed we have much good to learn from his simple and healthful outdoor life and high-principled characteristics.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The daily lives of the American pioneers, the men and women who braved the dangers of unexplored forests and the hardships of an unsettled country, furnish us with still better ideals. From them directly comes the idea of &quot;preparedness&quot; for all things and for any emergency. They were friendly, kind, helpful, trustworthy, loyal, courteous, reverent, clean, cheerful, thrifty, and brave. We seek to typify and commemorate the principles of their character in the Scout Oath, the Scout Motto, and the Scout Law in the ideals of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To Ernest Thompson Seton and Daniel Carter Beard great credit must be given for their admirable work in commemorating excellent precepts in the lives of the Indians and Pioneers by the development of their <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>organizations, &#8212; the (Seton) Woodcraft Indians and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Pioneers by Mr. Beard. They have given, great ideals to all boys, and are ever ready to give aid from the fulness of their knowledge and experience. The several books which each have</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Child-Life a Recapitulation of Man-History.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is a fact generally accepted by psychologists that the child recapitulates the history of man&#39;s development,<span class="gstxt_sup">12</span> in his growth from his first origin through infancy into manhood. Professor Baldwin says: &quot;The individual in embryo passes through stages which represent morphologically to a degree the stages actually found in the ancestral animal series.&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">13</span> In the same way as the human embryo passes through various stages of development closely resembling like embryonic animal forms,<span class="gstxt_sup">14</span> so too does the life of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in his growth from infancy into manhood.<span class="gstxt_sup">15</span> As has been previously pointed out in a former chapter, there is one period of the boy&#39;s development which exactly coincides with this historical world-period of chivalry, and in which the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>lives over again the desires which affected his forefathers through that period of world-history.<span class="gstxt_sup">16</span> So just as we interpret the needs of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>and gain a better understanding of his likes and dislikes by interpreting the periods of his life according to the development of man&#39;s history, so the sooner it is recognized by the student of boyhood what the requisites of training must be during the chivalry period of the boy&#39;s development.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Chivalry Period of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy-Life. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The period of chivalry or early adolescence in <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>extends generally from thirteen to sixteen years of age, - immediately following and constituting a later development of the gang age, and forming an introduction to the middle adolescent or self-assertive age.<span class="gstxt_sup">17</span> This youthful period is closely parallel to the racial feudal period of history in its characteristics. In that time of knighthood, man was imbued with the desire to emulate the chosen leader, lord, or</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>king, to seek through service of a master the path to glory and happiness,&#8212; this was an age of hero-worship. This is approximately true, as well, of this period of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life. Gradually the boy&#39;s allegiance is turned from loyalty to his gang toward his leader, and the impulse toward heroworship is developed. At this time the will to do or not to do is not gang-decision, but the decision of the gang leader or the teacher. The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>prefers leadership games, such as follow-the-leader, captained baseball or football, and loves pomp, display, and drill work, under his chosen captain or general; he cares to be seen doing things under the direction of Mr. (Williams), his leader, or to be known as one of &quot;Beany&#39;s&quot; Bunch. &quot;The boy&#39;s will,&quot; says Mr. Fiske, &quot;now typifies the spirit of obedience.&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">1S</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Personal Traits of the Leader.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This period of <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-life </span>develops the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who leads and the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who follows. This <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>leader of the gang may develop the personal traits of the bully, if he is attracted by the fighting qualities and animal force of some man he seeks to copy in character, or he may be the force through his selection of his own hero which will lead to the solid character building of all of his followers.<span class="gstxt_sup">17</span> The boys who follow, at first will seek to emulate the deeds of their leader, and later seek to surpass him in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">development </span>in them of self-assertiveness. Therefore in <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>training, and especially in the influence of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>for good, the question of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-leadership </span>must always be considered, and such steps adopted as will continue the natural development of boys in the life-period, under correcting and advisory influences. Fortunately the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>leader in clublife more often selects as his hero a strong-charactered older <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>or an adult leader, and usually success in character building follows for the control of himself and all of his followers.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Relative Leadership.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Relative leadership under a strongly centralized control, then, is the key to this period,&quot; <i><span class="gstxt_sup">1a</span> </i>says George W. Fiske, in his &quot;<span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy-Life </span>and Self-Government.&quot; &quot;We may count on a strong personal loyalty from the boys, if</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>we have any sort of a personality to attract it, and we may also count on a large degree of team work and willingness to serve under the order of superiors. The difficulty is to choose officers so wisely that they will get the boys&#39; support.&quot; When this support is gained the direction of the boys&#39; attention may be turned toward almost any field of activity, for <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy-interest </span>will follow good leadership enthusiasm in almost any phase of development. Here then is the leader&#39;s chance to lay the foundations for best character traits, to turn the boy&#39;s attention to the good and the beautiful and the pure in life, and to direct the actions of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>by example and leadership towards the habits of the chivalry ideal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy-Leader </span>and Adult Group Leader.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;In <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life, the period from twelve to fifteen is a stormy period,&quot; says Dr. Winfield S. Hall.<span class="gstxt_sup">20</span> &quot;The <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>recognizes physical force and combines in cliques, gangs, clubs, &#39;bunches,&#39; under leaders, who are not elected but who maintain their position by pure physical force and are leaders, by common consent, only so long as they possess the physical force to compel recognition of their denomination. As soon as we recognize this race manifestation in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy, </span>it becomes evident that any attempt to reason the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>out of these natural instincts will be futile and time worse than wasted. Tactful leaders of boys joining in the spirit of organization of small clubs, will get them out into the woods and fields, where each <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>may reenact the ancestral struggle which he in his individual development is now repeating.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Importance of the Hero-Story and Folk-Tales.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The leader should encourage the boys to read of heroes of his race, or tell stories of these heroes setting forth &quot;their physical attributes in glowing terms that will make every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>wish to attain as nearly as possible this heroic type of physical manhood.&quot; In the campfire and evening storytalks, &quot; the leader has a splendid opportunity &#8212; after he has hypnotized the group &#8212; to suggest ideals of manhood which will profoundly influence the life of every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the group.&quot;</p>

we use the term to include all the precepts of the Scout Law, for in reality chivalry is the ultimate and combined result of all the effects of the Scout Law. As Mr. John L.

The awakening of these virtues in a <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>is to awaken manhood.&quot; All of the great principles of life that are character building and creative of service are typified in one or the other of these twelve Scout Law principles; or in these five word-precepts.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>&quot;The Daily Good Turn.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout promises to obey these precepts of the Scout Law when he takes the Scout Oath, but he may not fully understand exactly the meaning of each of these different word-terms. This must be finally accomplished by the leadership of the Scout Master through explanation and demonstration, and the encouraged habit of the &quot;Daily Good Turn.&quot; It is this latter act which will serve most to enjoin obedience to the Scout Law ideals, and make each a governing and habitual influence in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts&#39; </span>life. We therefore, in our desire to have each of the boys do one good turn daily, hope to stamp the principles of chivalry,&#8212; the Scout Law Precepts,&#8212; upon all his future life.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This &quot;Daily Good Turn,&quot; however, should be a spontaneous action of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy. </span>The Scout does this good turn on his honor as a Scout and his action should always seem most natural. A practice of telling of the act should never be compulsory or encouraged, for such a practice might lead to vaingloriousness or self-conceit and would certainly belittle the value of the act. It is far better that both the good turn itself and the boy&#39;s account of it be wholly spontaneous, and he should be taught that it is not the right thing to speak about his good act unless he is asked about it particularly by his Scout Master or Scout Commissioner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This &quot; Daily Good Turn,&quot; the daily doing of some special act of kindness or politeness, engenders in the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>who faithfully lives up to his Scout Laws, the growing habit of politeness and gentlemanly kindness. &quot;To be thoughtful of others first of all,&quot; says Orison Swett Marden, &quot; is a sacred duty which no man who pretends to gentility can afford to ignore.&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">25</span> &quot;There is a zest in doing good,&quot; says James</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>The Habit of Doing Good.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The habit of doing a kind deed every time there has been a chance to do so has been characteristic of many great men. Many are the anecdotes and reminiscences of such kindnesses in the lives of our great Americans. The little courtesies, little kindnesses, pleasant words, genial smiles, good wishes, and good deeds &#8212; these form the real basis of the happiness of life. &quot;Once in a lifetime a heroic act may be performed,&quot; says George W. Childs, the great philanthropist, &quot; but the opportunity to do one of the little things that make life beautiful comes every day and every hour. If we make the apparently trifling events of life beautiful and good, then our whole existence will be full of harmony and sweetness.<span class="gstxt_sup">27</span> Learn to think of others before thinking of yourself, and you will have friends enough, and of the best.&quot;</p>

To do unto others as you would have others do unto you, the Golden Rule, is the fairest precept ever laid down. &quot;It breathes a spirit of unselfishness,&quot; says Orison Swett Marden. &quot;It teaches equality, reciprocity, and self-respect.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">28</span> &quot;The world loves a Lincoln, because he sacrificed self, comfort, ease, health itself, and even jeopardized his life because he loved the people. The world loves a Florence Nightingale because she gave up ease, comfort and the luxuries of home to administer to the sick and wounded soldiers in the filth and disease of the camp. The world has no use for the man who lives only for himself. It gives its love and laurels to the chivalrous and kind. It gives them to the soldier, the fireman, the nurse, the engineer, the sailor,&#8212; every one who gives his life for others. We cannot get the world&#39;s love and esteem by paying for it in advance.&quot; &quot;God,&quot; it is said, &quot; has made selfishness unlovable and shaped the universal heart to</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The most important characteristics that make for efficient manhood are faith, unbending rectitude, self-control, a brave spirited Christian manliness, and social service for the betterment of humanity. Of all these, &quot;service,&quot; says Mr. Alexander, &quot; is the summing up word &quot; for all the principles and ideals of Chivalry. &quot;It is service which speaks the &#39;daily good turn,&#39; and adjusts the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>to the interest of the community.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>. Scout Executive, Boston, Mass.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Problem of Securing Good Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The problem which every Scout Master must face &#8212; that of securing and developing competent Patrol Leaders &#8212; is readily accepted by all who support that important office as the most difficult, yet most vital one to which they can direst their attention. The pleasure and satisfaction of their efforts are assured by the way in which they approach and solve this problem. Creation of leaders means the developing of character, personality, resourcefulness, genuineness, and capacity and readiness to meet responsibility. To set one&#39;s self to the study of this problem is to accept no mean task and one to which a Scout Master should give much serious consideration. If his success is only partial, his efforts in behalf of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>and of the patrol will bring many reciprocal advantages.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>That almost every man is eager to know more of this particular phase of his Scout work is evident to all who have had an opportunity to know intimately or observe casually their difficulties. Almost every Scout Master is glad to have special information and is ready to benefit by the experiences of others &#8212; perhaps improving on methods of his own. The success of any man in Scout work depends upon his ability to employ the interests and talents of his followers. For example, one man may take a group of boys on a hike and allow them to return feeling they have do le him an honor by accompanying him, while another man may take the same group on a similar hike and have them feel that they have been greatly favored. The first man undoubtedly means well and is as interested in the group as the second, but he fails to respect certain essential principles of Leadership. It is highly probable that when the first man sets out with the group, he has no definite aim or end in view; the activities they follow are<span class='gtxt_body'>
made to appear arduous; his relations toward them are too familiar and undignified; and he lacks that supreme optimism and good humor which gives life and zest to every activity. The necessary elements of Leadership in him are sadly wanting. Perhaps a brief review of the observations and deductions of a few successful Leaders will be helpful.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The Approach to the Problem.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the organization Bulletin it is stated that as soon as practicable a Scout Master is to select six boys (from a group of twenty-four that have been brought together at the first meeting) as his leaders and assistants and with them form special Patrols. Continuing it says: &quot;Begin at once to train these boys in the Tenderfoot requirements, when they have passed the examinations call your first regular meeting for organization. Your twenty-four boys may be formed into three Patrols of eight boys each, with a trained Patrol Leader and an Assistant Patrol Leader in charge of each. The fact that these leaders have a knowledge of Scouting and have passed the Tenderfoot requirements will give them prestige among the other boys. Give your leaders real responsibility. Let them feel that their special task is to teach, influence and lead the boys of their Patrol and that unless they do it no else will.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;In grouping boys in Patrols it is advisable to form Patrols of boys as near the same age as possible, taking into consideration the natural instincts of the boys and their desire for association with one another. This is often a more important factor than age.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;While the Patrol Leaders are preparing the boys in their Patrols for the Tenderfoot degree, continue your instructions of the Leaders and Assistants in Second Class Scout requirements, so that they will be able as Second Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>to instruct the boys in their Patrols. In like manner have them qualify as First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts.&quot; </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The last quoted paragraph might lead one to think that the training of Patrol Leaders and of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>through the Patrol Leaders is all very simple and may become a purely mechanical process. That it is not, however, one quickly finds when beginning Scout work. If a man who is to be a Scout Master knows little of the boys, and is even less familiar with the Scout program and activities and the development of proficiency in these, he should spend some little time in becoming acquainted with the prospective <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span><span class='gtxt_body'>
(individually and collectively) and in seeking to learn their peculiar temperaments and interests. During this period, which need not be longer than two or three weeks, he should follow a general program with which he is thoroughly familiar and which has proven to be useful. At the end of this preparatory or experimental stage of his work a Scout Master is ready to meet the more engaging and difficult problems of organizing and developing his group. Certain elemental principles cannot be ignored. Recognition of a man as Scout Master presupposes his ability to share responsibility, to provide acceptable tasks and to stimulate a desire for progress to the highest Scout ranking. A wise leader, recognizing the inherent desire of every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>for fair play and for promotion, will reason out for his benefit all points which puzzle and bewilder, and will make the eagerness to become proficient in one activity serve as a steppingstone to proficiency in other necessary activities. Together with these he must encourage self-government, making it an actual and usable part of their association. Self-government is always good where it is not abused. So much latitude must be allowed in this for local conditions and previous experiences, both of the Scout Master and his boys, that it is difficult to give definite and clear instructions which can be generally followed. The Scout Master must always be the guiding factor. When he ceases to become so, he loses his position of leadership. If his influence is felt rather than dominantly asserted, it is far more valuable. Several means might be suggested of letting the members of his Patrol know his attitude on subjects. For example, to use two widely different situations &#8212; before the election of patrol officers or before a meeting at which they are to define their attitude toward the question of smoking, the Scout Master should meet the individuals of his Patrol and give them a clear, intelligent conception of the importance of their decision, letting them realize how their action can shape the decision of other members of the Patrol. The Scout Master will thus enable those who have had no experience in considering such matters to follow the course which would result in much good to the Patrol. A Scout Master would be unfair were he to dictate what the decision should be, but his outlining and explanation of issues should be so clear that an intelligent solution or conclusion is made possible. Where it is impossible or impracticable</span><span class='gtxt_body'>
to take such matters up with individuals of the Patrol the same general course should be followed before the group. Self-government means exactly what the term implies but, contrary to custom, as much emphasis should be placed on the word <i>government </i>as on the word <i>self. </i>Best leadership is that which governs indirectly or by suggestion so that the boys believe there has been a real self-governing decision. It is necessary that every member of the Patrol be intelligently aware of what he is doing or about to do and that he be instructed in the most profitable means of accomplishing what he honestly believes it is his duty to accomplish. When groups of boys are brought to this point of view, self-government will be made not only possible but distinctly useful. The Scout Master who has brought to his service this valuable asset can also be sure that he is on the right road to the accomplishment of an end which is of large importance in Scouting &#8212; that of handing over to the <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>the knowledge the Scout Master has gained through his longer experience.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It stands without need of explanation that a capable man will allow for boyishness wherever it crops out and will direct it to his ends. Enthusiasm, vigor, self-assertion and rivalry &#8212; all will be permitted to remain in evidence and constitute a generous part of the Patrol life. If such qualities are lacking Scout Masters will have abundant cause for distress and should exercise every energy and ability they can summon to bring about a change. A Scout Master should consider his work a failure if he makes his <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>prematurely old and supremely proper. He will defeat the end toward which he should be working and will find that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>he is training will never be able to draw a large group of energetic companions into their organization. Moreover, and what is worse, he will not equip them to meet the responsibilities they should later assume. His influence must be counted a positive detriment. Having an abundance of animal life present in a troop, but under control, is the thing to which a Scout Master can justly point with pride.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>Selection of a Patrol Leader.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt">Assuming </span>that a patrol consisting of eight prospective <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>has been brought together and the preliminary steps of organization taken, that is, that they have been instructed in the activities and duties incumbent upon <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>and that</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>they have been grouped according to their ages, instincts, interests, etc., we realize that the Scout Master is then confronted with one of the most important and telling phases of Scout work,&#8212; the election and development of his several leaders. He must constantly keep in mind the requisites of a leader &#8212; understanding that his leader must be representative, resourceful, and a fellow of grit and courage. He need not be the best <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>in the group considered from purely moral standards as it is a Scout Master&#39;s duty to develop the best side of every boy&#39;s nature. He should begin doing so by working with the leader.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The importance of selecting the right leader cannot be over-emphasized. Occasionally boys will be found who have taken upon themselves the role of leadership without being so respected by their companions. Such cases are frequently the result of either selfishness or an exaggerated sense of individual importance. They are, however, none the less worthy of consideration. Scout Masters should be careful not to neglect or misuse cases in which evidence of these faults are manifested. These tendencies are immensely human and can be trained to valuable account. Scout Masters will often find that such individuals genuinely befriended become his greatest allies, and his most promising students. Responsibility often makes good Patrol Leaders out of unpromising material.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Scout Masters are frequently called upon to decide whether or not they shall appoint a Patrol Leader or have the members of the Patrol elect him, or let the entire troop participate in the election. For obvious reasons different methods should be followed under different conditions. A Scout Master who has had no previous experience either with boys or with the Scout program might follow one course, while a Scout Master who has had several years of experience with boys, who is a natural Scout, and who is working with a group that has been previously organized for some other purpose might follow a different course. As this is written for those seeking help it is not out-of-theway to assume that they have had no large experience with a group of boys and are only slightly familiar with Scout work. A man finding himself in this class should first of all make it his duty to become thoroughly acquainted with every <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>with whom he is to deal. The members of the patrol or troop should work together for several meetings<span class='gtxt_body'>
without having any regular Patrol Leader. At the end of such time a Scout Master should adopt one of the two following methods: &#8212; Either (1) appoint a Scout who appears to be the natural and most promising leader as temporary Patrol Leader, permitting him to take charge of the patrol (letting it be understood, of course, that he is only on trial) or (2) have an election in which every member of the patrol participates. This latter method is preferable where <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>have had an opportunity to work for higher Scout ranking, when it will frequently be found that those who have done the best Scout work will be chosen as leaders. If a Scout Master follows the first course, he should allow the temporary leader to serve only for a short time. Others of the patrol should be given an opportunity to qualify under the same conditions until such time as the election can profitably be held or until the Scout Master has satisfied himself that a certain leader should be appointed.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Term of Office.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The term of office.for a Patrol Leader should be one year, at the end of which time he could be reelected or dismissed as the Patrol or Scout Master may see fit. Sometimes conditions arise which make it desirable for the Patrol Leader to step back into the rank of ordinary Scout. In most instances, however, it is better to have him continue in office. The interests and influence of a Scout Master should be felt in deciding this point. If conditions arise which necessitate a change in Patrol Leaders before the end of a year, such as would occur in the case of resignation, transfer, or dishonorable removal, the office should be filled at once.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Development of Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Patrol Leader should be the actual leader of the patrol. For a patrol the members of which average between the ages of thirteen and fifteen, the leader need not be the oldest. He should be selected purely on his merits. When there is a great difference between the ages of the oldest and youngest members &#8212; a condition to be avoided &#8212; one of the oldest boys should be the Patrol Leader, but not necessarily the oldest. <i>Ability </i>rather than age is the basis upon which the ultimate decision rests. Frequently the two go together. The Patrol Leader should be given full charge of developing and carrying out the activities assigned to <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>under him. It is his duty tc arouse the spirit of<span class='gtxt_body'>
unity and strength without which a patrol cannot succeed and without which patrol life is impossible. To this end the Scout Master must help the Leader by encouraging the use of Patrol competitions and a system of merits by which the advancement of the individual is put to the credit of the patrol rather than to the purely selfish account. (Cf. the Merit System for Troops and Patrols outlined in Chapter VI; this Merit System should be used consistently). It subsequently becomes the duty of the Patrol Leader to prod the lazy and indifferent and encourage the thrifty and ambitious of his group. If the members of a patrol wish to specialize in any one subject, say First Aid, they should be allowed to do so provided, of course, such extra work is not done to the detriment of their general progress. When the Patrol specializes, the leader should interest himself especially in First Aid and see to it that instruction necessary for every member is available. The Patrol Leader should make it his duty to get a physician to teach First Aid rather than depend upon the Scout Master. This does not mean that he is not to cooperate with the Scout Master in getting the physician, but rather that the necessary work of interesting and securing him devolves upon the leader.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Patrol Leaders should regularly be given full charge of meetings of patrols. &#9830; When the troop is called together the advanced Patrol Leader, or more correctly, the leader of the patrol doing the best work, should be in charge. This honor may occasionally be given other Patrol Leaders, but should not be given in successive rotation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As a means of properly developing Patrol Leaders let the Scout Master have frequent special meetings for Patrol Leaders alone. At such times he should be freely confidential and painstaking in his outlining of problems peculiar to their patrols as well as the problems of general concern to their troop. In all matters pertaining to the welfare of the troop Scout Masters must be guided to a very large extent by the combined opinions of Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Conference and Councils for Development.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Conferences and Councils need not be frequent but should be real. A Scout Master will find his energies better utilized if he can encourage Patrol Leaders to arrange these conferences rather than arrange them for himself. The initiative of a Scout Master, if a positive factor at all, will stimulate that of the Patrol Leader. The stimulus should<span class='gtxt_body'>
come in other ways, however, than through the direct suggestion of matters of business that are to be advanced for mutual consideration. Many topics presented for discussion at Patrol Leaders&#39; Conferences will naturally be reported at later meetings of the Patrol and of the Troop. In such cases it will generally be desirable to have the Patrol Leaders present the matter rather than to allow them to depend upon the Scout Master. The Scout Master will find it greatly to his interests to share every problem he has with his leaders. At all Scout gatherings Patrol Leaders should not only be made to carry out the Scout Master&#39;s orders, but should be given a liberal range of authority in originating plans and giving orders of their own.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Patrol Leaders should seldom be in complete charge of a patrol hike. If no senior officer can attend, the hike should be postponed. At least the Assistant Scout Master should be present with the Patrol on all such occasions. Great care should be taken to comply with property regulations, fire laws, etc. For this reason alone a person over eighteen should accompany the Patrol. In camp or field, the Leader should be given much the same duties they would have at indoor meetings. Discretion must be used in assigning tasks to the Patrol Leader and in depending on him to instruct his subordinates in the various branches of scouting activities that are made a part of their excursion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Uses of Patrol Leaders in Teaching Requirements.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Instructions in the simple requirements or in all the regular subjects in which the Leader is thoroughly proficient should be left to his charge. It should be made his duty to see that all candidates for examination belonging to his Patrol are fully equipped to pass the requirements on which they will be examined before they present themselves to the Troop Committee or the Local Court of Honor. The Patrol Leader may call upon his assistants or any other of his <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>for help, in fact, he should be encouraged to do so in all situations that make it practicable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Disciplining of Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When Patrol Leaders are wisely chosen they seldom require severe disciplining. Nevertheless, whenever it is<span class='gtxt_body'>
needed it is highly important that it be administered no less rigorously than that administered to ordinary <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span>It must of course be distinctly different and the method of application as peculiar as is the nature of his office. For cases of mild insubordination, which may be frequent with the new Leader in whom consciousness of his official importance is undeveloped, the punishment should come in the form of kindly, but none the less positive advice. He should be made to realize at the outset that as Patrol Leader he must be a model for other members of his Patrol. Failure to live up to the Scout principles, must be treated with severity as being a serious offense. Scout Masters should, however, take unto themselves no small share of the punishment for this because it is in the Leader doubtless due to the same cause that induces it in any Scout &#8212; namely, the lack of having these principles made sufficiently plain and attractive. When all <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>are made to understand that they can retain their Scout name with its attendant positions only so long as they respect and obey the Scout Oath and Law, the Scout &quot;Master will have little necessity of subjecting them to any sort of humiliation, because of failure to live as true <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts. </span></span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Decisions on courses of punishment for wanton disrespect and insubordination on the part of the Patrol Leaders must never be placed in the hands of officers ranking below Patrol Leaders. The matter must be adjusted by the Scout Master and his immediate assistants &#8212;if possible between the Scout Master, himself, and the offender. Occasionally a Patrol Leader becomes indifferent to the progress of his Patrol; sometimes he himself fails to progress to higher Scout ranking as rapidly as he should. Such a leader should be treated in one of the following three ways:&#8212;(1) His ambition should be aroused by stimulating inter-Patrol non-athletic competitions; (2) by depriving him and his patrol of the most attractive scout associations; (3) or (this should be the last resort) by removing him from his office and reducing him to the rank of ordinary Scout. If the plan of using Patrol competition is adopted, this competition should be used for instruction rather than for selfish display,&#8212; the various features of it being so arranged that his weakness as well as the weakness of the Patrol is successfully demonstrated. If the second course is followed,&#8212; that of temporary ostri</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>cism, it would be most effective to keep them from participating in any event which they were eager to enjoy. Discretion must constantly be exercised so that the Patrol Leader will have no opportunity to feel that he is being unfairly discriminated against and that no animosity exists.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Growth of Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The metal and abilities of the Patrol Leader should constantly be tested. No more effective and valuable means of doing this can be found than the unselfish and definite provision of actual responsibility. A Patrol Leader should grow. Constant exercise and work is necessary. Every man who has enough perception to understand himself and has sufficient introspective power to analyze his own development from boyhood to manhood is compelled to realize that his strength came by the increasingly large responsibility he gradually assumed. By intelligent guidance a Scout Master can turn the energies of his Leaders to immensely valuable account; Therefore every effort should be made by the Scout Master to give to his Patrol Leaders as much opportunity for individual responsibility and initiative as possible. In so doing he will be making the best and surest progress towards the ultimate goal of Scouting,&#8212; the development of manhood and character.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Selection of Assistant Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Assistant Patrol Leaders may be selected either by the Patrol Leader, by the Scout Master or by the members of the Patrol. In most cases it is preferable to let the Patrol Leader select his assistants, himself. The term of office should be the same as that of the Leader. This matter is usually regulated by the adoption of a Troop Constitution and By-Laws.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Development of Assistant Patrol Leaders.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Assistant Patrol Leaders must be developed in much the same way that Patrol Leaders are. As assistants they must work under the direction of their leader and cooperate with him in developing and maintaining a high standing of excellency in all branches of Scout activity. If the more menial or servile tasks fall to his lot,&#8212; as they often will,&#8212; he should see that they are completed with all the thoroughness and dignity becoming a Leader. His duties should be as specific and binding as are those of<span class='gtxt_body'>
his superior. Wherever it is possible for the Patrol Leader to delegate tasks to his assistants he should be expected and encouraged to do so. The Assistant may rightly be considered the go-between for ordinary <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>and higher officers &#8212; as such he should see that the point of view of each group is shared by the other; that criticisms of conditions are either definitely rejected or as definitely sustained; and that rules and courses of action are clearly understood and intelligently accepted before,&#8212; at all events, as soon as,&#8212; they are promulgated. He must represent both <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>and Leaders, seeing that the obligations of each are appreciated and accepted.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED AT THE THIRD ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At the third annual meeting of the National Council on February 11th, 1913, the following resolutions were fully discussed, and after careful consideration and modification were unanimously passed in the construction and content herewith given:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. WHEREAS the members of the National Council are convinced that the movement has proven to be a positive factor for good in the lives of boys who come within its influence and that there is abundant evidence showing marked improvement among boys who are carrying out its program, and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>WHEREAS the movement has proven to be a valuable asset to other organizations engaged in boys&#39; work, and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>WHEREAS the development of the idea of International brotherhood among <span class="gstxt_hlt">scouts </span>promises to become an effective factor in promoting universal peace.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>BE IT RESOLVED that the National Council express its sincere appreciation of the public spirited service that men are giving throughout the country as Scout Masters, Scout Commissioners, members of Local Councils, etc., in carrying forward this work for the boys of America.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. RESOLVED: That greater emphasis be placed upon the outdoor features of the Scout program and that as a part of the yearly plan of each troop effort should be made to provide for a period of camp-life some time during the year for every enrolled Scout.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. RESOLVED: That Scout Masters be urged to emphasize constantly the Scout virtues of chivalry, respect and the &quot;Daily Good Turn,&quot; and make constant effort to eliminate militarism and use only such drill as is needed to teach the boys to move promptly and in an orderly manner from one place to another, always keeping in mind the importance of peace scouting. The staves are to be in no wise considered or made use of as dummy muskets.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. RESOLVED: That in carrying out the Scout program as prescribed in the Official Handbook, the Scout<span class='gtxt_body'>
Masters and others in charge of the different groups be perfectly free to incorporate as much of ceremony, symbolism, dance, song, games and other activities as may be found adaptable to their needs.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. RESOLVED: That Local Councils should cooperate with organizations or institutions doing boys&#39; work, and that in case any such organization or institution forms a troop to carry out the program of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America and uses the name of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America, such organization should, whenever practicable, be invited to designate an adult representative other than the Scout Master to serve as a member of the Local Council and that such organization should be in honor bound to have its troops and its Scout Masters conform to the regulations made by the Local and National Councils; and further in the interests of making the work of the troop permanent and securing necessary support, in many cases it will prove helpful to have a troop committee of three or five men interested in Scouting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. RESOLVED: That a Second Class Scout should remain in that rank for at least two months, unless the circumstances are exceptional, before being permitted to take the test to become a First Class Scout, and that special care should be taken in awarding merit badges to guard against a mere technical compliance with the tests as set forth in the Handbook.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. RESOLVED: That whenever practical, especially in large communities, all final tests for Second Class and First Class <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>as well as for merit badges be given by and before the Court of Honor or some other committee appointed by the Local Council, such committee to meet at least quarterly, rather than by the individual Scout Master in charge of the candidate for examination; that the Tenderfoot requirements should be equally standardized with the others, and that Scout Masters should be advised to make this ceremony one that will have a lasting impression upon the candidate.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In communities where no Local Council exists it is recommended that the Scout Master secure the assistance of a Local Committee of representative men, including the Superintendent or Principal of Schools in passing upon these various qualifications.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. RESOLVED: That a plan be adopted whereby<span class='gtxt_body'>
Scout Masters&#39; Commissions be granted for a probationary period of six months during which time the Scout Master may have an opportunity to satisfy himself as to his personal qualifications for the work and demonstrate to the Local Council his ability as a leader of boys. At the expiration of this period a commission may be granted for a period of one year to be renewed annually upon the recommendation of his Local Council, on condition that the Scout Master has kept up an active interest in the work and has provided the Local Council with such regular reports as may be required.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In territories where Local Councils do not exist each Scout Master should be required to present satisfactory evidence to National Headquarters that he has maintained the standard as set forth in the Official Handbook and satisfactorily conducted the work of his troop and himself as a Scout Master during the period of probation and each successive year of his commission.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>9. RESOLVED: That the National Council recommend that intoxicating liquors be not used in connection with Scout meetings, and that all Scout Masters and other officials while on active duty refrain from the use of tobacco, and that those who are accustomed to the use of tobacco, do not conceal the fact from the boys, but discuss frankly with them the desirability of refraining from its use until they have attained their full development.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>10. RESOLVED: That a system of record keeping be prepared for individual patrol and troop work, and that this be recommended for use to the Local Council and Scout Masters to the end that there may be a uniform method of record keeping throughout the country.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>11. RESOLVED: That a definite responsibility for the work of the patrol should be placed upon the patrol leader, the assistant patrol leader, and the individual <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>and wherever practicable that for each troop a Scout Scribe, Scout Secretary or Tally Keeper should be appointed to keep careful records and reports of meetings and activities in a book to be known as the Tally Book, Log or Troop Record. This will assist the Scout Master in furnishing the necessary records to the Local Council and the National Headquarters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>12. RESOLVED: That in all districts where there is a Local Council efficiently organized, such Local Council</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>13. RESOLVED: That the Local Council and Scout Masters where there are no Local Councils, be asked to consider the adoption of a plan approved by the Executive Board for securing the cooperation and interest of parents and friends through an annual three dollar membership, one dollar of which will be used for local needs, one dollar as a subscription to BOYS&#39; LIFE MAGAZINE, and one dollar for the work of the National Headquarters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>14. RESOLVED: That a plan be devised whereby the Local Councils may be given an opportunity to subscribe a definite amount annually toward the support of the National work.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>15. RESOLVED: That each Local Council be requested to supply National Headquarters with at least three copies of all new printed matter issued and that Local Councils be urged to exchange printed matter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>16. RESOLVED: That it be recommended to Local Councils and to Scout Masters where there are no Local Councils that some time during the week beginning February 8th, which is the anniversary of the Incorporation of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy Scouts </span>of America, a special program be arranged for the purpose of bringing to the attention of the community the aim and scope of the Scout movement from a national point of view. Wherever possible, the mayor and other city officials who distinctively stand for the principles of the Scout movement as well as educational authorities and other men in the community actively interested in <span class="gstxt_hlt">boy </span>life should be invited to take part in some program for the purpose of reviewing the local work for the year and presenting the facts as to the movement throughout the United States and other countries.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At some time during this week each troop might have a special meeting to be known as National Night, at which time emphasis should be placed upon the opportunity which boys already in the Scout movement have to do one great &quot;good turn&quot; and might be permitted to make a troop con<span class='gtxt_body'>tribution for <span class="gstxt_hlt">Boy </span>Scout work in unorganized sections of the country through the National Headquarters. This contribution might consist of the regular weekly dues for one week of the patrol or troop.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In presenting the nation-wide aspect of the work emphasis should be placed upon the possibilities of the Scout movement in developing the idea of the brotherhood of men and proving a positive factor in hastening the day of universal peace.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>17. RESOLVED: That the National Headquarters should provide as soon as funds will permit a corps of competent field secretaries whose services will be available to Local Councils and to Scout Masters&#39; and Commissioners&#39; Conferences as an aid in developing and standardizing the work; the expense for travel and entertainment incident to such visits should, in so far as possible, be borne by the local organization.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>18. RESOLVED: That the National Headquarters cooperate in the holding of Scout conferences or institutes throughout the year in various parts of the United States, such gatherings to be held by conveniently located Local Councils that are willing to help in this way in the improvement of the Scout work.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>19. RESOLVED: That as an incentive to further proficiency in Scoutcraft, the Local Council so far as practical should award tenderfoot, 2nd Class, 1st Class and merit badges without charge to <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>who are qualified for them and that National Headquarters should furnish without charge the Life, Star and Eagle Badges as awards for the highest degrees in Scouting and the Honor Medal to <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts </span>who have qualified for life saving.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>20. RESOLVED: That we recommend that the troops cooperate with the public authorities in the conservation of those forms of plant and animal life which are useful, and the prevention and destruction of those animals and pests such as flies, mosquitoes, rats, etc., that are harmful, and, further, that in order to have the most beneficial effect upon the <span class="gstxt_hlt">Scouts, </span>the Scout Masters make clear to their troops that all such actions should be taken for the benefit of humanity and that humane methods be employed.</p>
