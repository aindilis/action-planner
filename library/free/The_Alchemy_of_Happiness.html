<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>INTRODUCTION.</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The remarkable treatise, which I introduce to your notice, is a translation from one of the numerous works of the Arabian Philosopher, Abou Ilamid Mohammed ben Mohammed al Ghazzali, who flourished in the eleventh century. He was born about the year A. <i>D. </i>1056, or 450 of the Mohammedan era, at Tous in Khorasan, and he died in the prime of life in his native country about the year 1111, or 505 A. H. Although educated by Mohammedan parents, he avows that during a considerable period of his life he was a prey to doubts about the truth, and that at times he was an absolute sceptic. While yet comparatively young, his learning and genins recommended him to the renowned sovereign Nizam ul Mulk, who gavo him a- professorship in the college which he had founded at Bagdad. His speculative mind still harassing him with doubts, in- his enthusiasm to arrive at a solid foundation for knowledge, he resigned his position, visited Mecca and Jerusalem, and finally returned to Khorasan, where he led a life of both monastic study and devotion, and consecrated his pen to writing the results of his meditations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Mohammedan scholars of the present day still hold him in such high respect, that his name is never mentioned by them without some such distinctive epithet, as the &quot;Scien<span class='gtxt_body'>tific Imanm,&quot; or &quot; Chief witness for Islamism.&quot; His rank in the eastern world, as a philosopher and a theologian, had naturally given his name some distinction in our histories of philosophy, aud it is enumerated in connection with those of Averroes (Abu Roshd) and Avicenna (Abu Sina) as illustrating the intellectual life and the philosophical schools of the Mohammedans. Still his writings were less known than either of the two others. His principal work, <i>The Destruction of the Philosophers, </i>called forth in reply one of the two most important works of Averroes entitled <i>The Destruction of the Destruction. </i>Averroes, in his commentary upon Aristotle, extracts from Ghazzali copiously for the purpose of refuting his views. A short treatise of his had been published at Cologne, in 1506, and Pocock had given in Latin his interpretation of the two fundamental articles of the Mohammedan creed. Von Hammer printed in 1838, at Vienna, a translation of a moral essay, <i>Eyuha el Welcd, </i>as a new year&#39;s token for youth.</span></p>

<a class='page'  id='PA6'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It has been reserved to our own times to obtain a more intimate acquaintance with Ghazzali, and this chiefly by means of a translation by M. Pallia, into French,of his <i>Confessions, </i>wherein he announces very clearly his philosophical views; aud from an essay on his writings by M. Smolders. In consequence, Mr. Lewes, who in his first edition of the <i>Biographical History of Philosophy, </i>found no place for Ghazzali, is induced in his last edition, from the evidenee which that treatise contains that he was one of the controlling minds of his age, to devote an entire section to an exhibition of his opinions in the same series with Abclard and Bruno, aud to make him the typical figure to represent Arabian philosophy. For <i>a </i>full account of Ghazzali&#39;s<span class='gtxt_body'>
school of philosophy, we refer to his history and to the two essays, just mentioned. We would ohserve, very briefly however, that like most of the learned Mohammedans of his age, he was a student of Aristotle. While they regarded all the Greek philosophers as infidels, they availed themselves of their logic and their principles of philosophy to maintain, as far possible, the dogmas of the Eoran. Ghazzali&#39;s mind possessed however Platonizing tendencies, and he affiliated himself to the Soofies or Mysties in his later years, He was in antagonism with men who to him appeared, like Aviccnna, tooxalt reason abovo tho Koran, yet ho himself went to tho extreme limits of reasoning in his endeavors to find nn intelligible basis for the doctrines of the Eoran, and a philosophical basis for a holy rulo of life. His character, and moral and intellectual rank are vividly depicted in tlie following extract from the writings of Tholuck, a prominent leader of the modern Evangelical school of Germany.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Ghazzali,&quot; says Tholuck, &quot; if ever any man have deserved the name, was truly a divine, and he may justly be placed on a level with Origcn, so remarkable was he for learning and ingenuity, and gifted with such a rare faculty for tho skillful and worthy exposition of doctrine. AH that is good, noble and sublime, which his great soul had compassed, he bestowed upon Mohammedanism; aud he adorned the doctrines of the Koran with so much piety and learning, that, in the form given them by him, they seem in my opinion worthy the assent of Christians. Whatsoever was most excellent in the philosophy of Aristotle or in the Soofi mysticism, he discreetly adapted to the Mohammedan theology. From every school, he sought the<span class='gtxt_body'>
means of shedding light and honor upon religion; while his sincere piety and lofty conscientiousness imparted to all his writings a sacred majesty. He was the first of Mohammedan divines.&quot; <i>(Bibliotheca Sacra, </i>vi, 233).</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Sale, in the preliminary discourse to his translation of the Koran, shows that he had discovered the peculiar traits of Ghazzali&#39;s mind; for wherever he gives an explanation of the Mussulman creed, peculiarly consonant to universal reason and opposed to superstition, it will be found that he quotes from him.1</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This treatise on the Alchemy of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Happiness, </span>or Kimiai Saadet, seems well adapted to extend our knowledge of the writings of Ghazzali and of the opinions current then and now in the Oriental world. Although it throws no light on any questions of geography, philology or political history, objects most frequently in view in translations from the Oriental languages, yet a book which exhibits with such plainness the opinions of so large a portion of the human race as the Mohammedans, on questions of philosophy, practical morality and religion, will always be as interesting to the general reader and to a numerous class of students, as the facts that may be elicited to complete a series of kings in a dynasty or to establish the site of an ancient city can be to the historiau or the geographer. I translate it from an edition published in Turkish in 1845 (A. II., 1260), at tho imperial printing press in Constan</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>tinoplc. As no books are allowed to be printed there which have not passed under the eyes of the censor, the doctrines presented in the book indicate, not only the opinions of eight hundred years since, but also what views are regarded as orthodox, or tolerated among the orthodox at tho present day. It has been printed also in Persian at Calcutta.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In form, the book contains a treatise on practical piety, but as is the case with a large proportion of Mohammedan works, the author, whatever may be his subject, finds a place for observations reaching far wide of his apparent aim, so our author is led to make many observations which develop his notions in anatomy, physiology, natural philosophy and natural religion. The partisans of all sorts of opinions will be interested in finding that a Mohammedan author writing so long since in the centre of Asia, had occasion to approve or condemn so many truths, speculations or fancies which are now current among us with the reputation of novelty. Many of the same paradoxes and problems that startle or fascinate in the nineteenth century are here discussed. He came in contact, among his contemporaries, with persons who made the sameg&#39; leral objections to natural and revealed religion, as understood by Mohammedans, as are in our days made to Christianity, or who porverted and abused the religion which they professed for their own ends, in the same manner as Christianity is abused among us. And he engaged with earnestness now truthfully, and now erroneously, in refuting these men. His usual stand-point in discussion is equally removed from the most extravagant mysticism, and literal and formal orthodoxy. He attempts a dignified blending of rea<span class='gtxt_body'>son and faith, requiring of his fellow men unfeigned piety in the temper and tone of an evangelical Christian. He reminds his readers, in these discourses, that they are not Mussulmans if they are satisfied with merely a nominal faith, and treats with scorn those who are spiritualists ouly in language and dress.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is too narrow a view to adopt, in regard to a man of the sublimo character of Ghazzali, that he obtained his ideas from any one school of thinkers, or that being in fellowship with the Booties, that ho was merely a Sooti. Ho was living in the centre of Aryan peoples and religions. Ho may have had his doctrine of the future life shaped by Zoroaster, and have been influenced by the missionaries of the Buddhists.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The practical religion taught in these homilies will givo a favorable opinion of the stato of mind of the moro intelligent Mussulmans. They contain not the Mohammedanism of the creed or the catechism, but of the closet and tho pulpit. Tho tenor of tho book establishes tho truth of Ibn Khallikau&#39;s rotnark in his <i>Biographical Dictionary </i>that &quot;Ghazzali&#39;s ruling passion was making public exhortations.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>While perusing these pages, and noticing how much of the language of Gbazzali corresponds in its representations of God, of a holy life and of eternity, with the solemn instructions to which wo have listouod from our infancy, wo may think of tho magicians who imitated the miracles of Moses with their enehautments. Yet assuredly a vivid and respectful interest must be awakened in our mind* for the races and nations, whose ideas of their relations as immortal beings are so serious and earnest.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The translation I have endeavored to make a close transcript of the meaning of the Turkish; having especially sought to find appropriate equivalents for native idioms. I have designated the chapter and verse of nearly every passago quoted from the Koran. The omissions in the text, which are made apparent by signs, are limited to digressions of the author, to repetitions and to some of the illustrations; so that thoro is no interruption of the continuity of thought in the thoraos discussed. The Turkish edition itsolf was but a portion of tho original work. Two or three notes are added, either explanatory of the text or illustrative of the author, from Oriental sources.</p>

If your qualities are chiefly animal, the essence of which is to eat and drink, you will day and night seek after these things.

And if you possess angelic qualities, whose nature it is to worship God in sincerity and continually to await the vision of His beauty, then like them you should unceasingly, resting neither day or night, be zealous and strive that you may become worthy of the vision of the Lord.

That heart, which is emphatically called spirit, does not belong to this world, and although it has come to this world, it has only come to leave it .

Beloved, strive to obtain this knowledge, for there is no more precious jowel. In its origin it comes from God, and again returns to him.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Bo sure, O seeker after knowledge! that it is impossible to obtain a, knowledge of the heart, until you know its essence and its true nature, its faculties, and its relations with its faculties,&#8212; nor until you know its attributes, and how through thorn tho knowledge of God is obtained, and what happinuss is, and how <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>is to bo secured. Know then, that the existence of the spirit is evident and is not involved in doubt. Still, it is not body, which is found in corpses and in animals generally. If a person with his eyes wide open should look upon the world and upon his own body, and then shut his eyes, everything would bo veiled from his view, so that he could not see even his own body. But the existence of his spirit would not be at the same time shut out from his view. Again, at death, tho body turns to earth, but the spirit undergoes no corruption. Still it is not permitted to us to know what the spirit is in its real nature and in its essence, as God says in his Holy Word: &quot;They will ask you about the spirit.

The creation spoken of in the verse is in the sense of foreordination and not of actual formation. Hence those who say that the spirit is created, and is also from all eternity are in error, for nothing is eternal except the being and attributes of God.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Thoso also, who say that the spirit is but an accident, are in error, for the spirit exists by itself in the body, and an accident is that which subsists with something else. And those who say that the spirit is matter are in error, for matter is that which can be divided, and spirit is not susceptible of division. There is spirit, beloved, which is called animal spirit, which is siisceptiblo of division. It is found in animals. But that spirit, which has tho property of knowing God, and which is called the heart, is not found in beasts, nor is it matter or an accident. The heart, on the contrary, has been created with angelic qualities. It is a substance of which it is difficult to apprehend the essence Tho law does not permit it to beexplaincd, hut there is no occasion for the student being acquainted with it at the outset of his journey. That which is necessary to the student is pious ardor and zeal, and this must be called into exercise in perfection. It is God who graciously teaches the student what spirit is, as we find in the IIoly Book: &quot;We will direct in our way, all those who shall strive to propagate our worship.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> And if a man does not strive earnestly for the faith, there is no use of explaining to him the essence of spirit.

<p class='gtxt_body'>in his Holy Word: &quot;And what shall teach thee the forces Of thy Lord?&quot; The heart was destined to acquire a knowledge of God, in which its <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>consists. But we cannot grow in the knowledge of God, unless we understand the works of God.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The works of God are apprehended by the senses, which are five, hearing, sight, taste, smell and touch. For such an arrangement of the senses, there was also need of a body. The body itself iscomposed of fourdiverse elements, water, earth, air and fire. Being, therefore, liable to decay, it is in continual danger of perishing from the external aud internal enemies that perpetually assail it. Its external enemies, are such as wild beasts, drowning and conflagrations; its internal enemies, such as hunger and thirst. For the purpose of resisting these, it was in want of various internal and external forces, such as the hand aud foot, sight and hearing, food and drink. And in this connection, for eating and drinking, it is in want of internal and external instruments like the hand, the mouth, the stomach, the powers of appetite and digestion. In addition to these instruments, there was need of means to guide in their occasional use, that is, for the internal senses. These are five, the faculties of perception, reflection, memory, recollection and imagination. Tlicir home is in the brain, aud each has a specific function, as is well known to the learned. If to any one of all these faculties and instruments an injury occurs, the actions of man are defective. Now all these are the agents of the heart and subject to its rule. If, for example, the heart gives permission to the ear, hearing results; if it gives permission to the eye, there follows sight; if it gives permission to the .foot, there is movement. All the other members are obedient in the same manner to the commands of the heart. The divine plan in all this arrangement is, that while the members preserve</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>the body for a few days from harm, the heart, in its vehicle the body, should pursue its business of cultivating the seeds of <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>for eternity and prepare for its journey to its native country. So long as the various forees of the body are obedient to the dictates of the heart, in like manner as the angels obey in the presence of God, no coutrariety of action can arise among them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, O student of wisdom! that the body, which is the kingdom of the heart, resembles a great city. The hand, the foot, the mouth and the other members resemble the people of the various trades. Desire is a standard bearer; anger is a superintendent of the city, the heart is its sovereign, aud reason is the vizier. The sovereign needs the service of all the inhabitants. But desire, the standard bearer, is a liar, vain and ambitious. He is always ready to do the. contrary of what reason, the vizier, commands. He strives to appropriate to himself whatever he sees in the city, which is the body. Anger, the superintendent, is rebellious and corrupt, quick and passionate. He is always ready to be enraged, to spill blood, and to blast one&#39;s reputation. If the sovereign, the heart, should invariably consult with reason, his vizier, and, when desire was transgressing, should give to wrath to have power over him (yet, without giving him full liberty, should make him angry in subjection to reason, the vizier, so that passing all bounds he should not streteh out his hand upon the kingdom), there would then be an equilibrinm in the condition of the kingdom, and all the members would perform the functions for which they were created, their service would be accepted at the merey seat, and they would obtain eternal felicity. . . .</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If you desire, inquirer for the way, with thankfulness for these mercies, to obtain eternal <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>in the future mansions, the heart must enthrone itself like a sovereign in its capital, the body, must stand at the door of service aud direct its prayers to the gate of eternal truth, seeking<span class='gtxt_body'>
for the beauty of the divinity. It must take reason for its vizier, desire for its standard bearer, anger to be the superintendent of the city, and taking the senses of reason as its spies, it must make each one of them responsible in its sphere. The pereeptive faculties which are foremost in the brain, it must make to be chiefs of the spies, that they may convey to the spies notices of what occurs in the world. Tho faculty of memory, which is next in order in the brain, it must use as a receptacle in which it may treasure up whatever is noticed by the spies, and, as occasion requires, may inform reason, the vizier. The vizier, in accordance with the information received, will administer the kingdom. When he sees any one of the soldiers revolting and following his own passions, he will represent it to the sovereign, that he may be controlled and conquered. He must not, however, be destroyed, for each one of us has received, from his original country, a definite commission, and in that case this service must remain unfulfilled. But, alas! if the heart should swerve from its sovereignty, and not make use of reason as its vizier, and should be reduced by the standard bearer, desire, and the superintendent, anger, all the forees would then follow in the train of desire and anger, the kingdom would fall into disorder, and everlasting ruin would be the result. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If you inquire, O student! how it is known that tho heart of man has boon created in accordance with tho qualities of angels, soring that tho most of tho qualities and attributes of angels aro foreign to it, I reply, you knew that there is not, in truth, any creature on the face of tho earth more noble than man, and that it belongs to the dignity and perfection of every creature, to work out perseveringly that service for which it was created. The ass, for instance, was created to bear burdens. If he carries his -load well, without stumbling or falling, or if he does not throw off his load, his qualities are in perfection, and bis service is accepted. The horse was designed also for war<span class='gtxt_body'>
and military expeditions, and has strength to carry burdens. If he performs his duty well, in time of war, in running, fleeing and going to meet the enemy, his service is accepted, and he will be treated with attention in his accoutrements, grooming and feeding.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Besides, beloved! if man hud been created only to eat and drink, it would follow that animals are of greater worth and excellence than man; for they can eat and drink more than man can, and they have useful services devolved upon them of drawing burdens, tilling the ground, and giving meat, butter aud milk for food. If also man had been created to fight, kill and domineer, it would follow that beasts of prey are nobler than he, for they are mightier in their ferocity and their power of subjugating other animals. There are, moreover, many animals of manifest utility, as the dog to watch and hunt, and the skins of some of them for clothing. It follows, therefore, that man was not created for these things, but rather to serve God aud to grow in the knowledge of him.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is plain that mind, discernment aud reason were bestowed upon man, that when he looks upon the world and sees in every object illustrations of various forms of perfection, and much to excite his wonder, he might turn his attention from the work of the artist, to the artist himself; from the thing formed to him that formed it; that he might comprehend his own excessive frailty and weakness, and the perfection of the wisdom and power, yea, of all the attributes of the eternal Creator, and that, without ceasing, he might humbly supplicate acceptance in his frailty and weakness on the one hand, aud oii the other might seek to draw near to the King of kings, and dually obtain rest in<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, thou seeker of divine mysteries! that there is no end to the wonderful operations of the heart. For, to pursue the same subject, the dignity of the heart is of two kinds; one kind is by means of knowledge, and the other through the exertion of divine power. Its dignity by means of knowledge is also of two kinds. The first is external knowledge, which every one understands: the second kind is veiled and cannot be understood by all, and is extremely precious. That which we have designated as external, refers to that faculty of the heart by which the sciences of geometry, medicine, astronomy, numbers, the science of law and nil the arts are understood; and although the heart is a thing which cannot bo divided, still the knowledge of all the world exists in it. All the world indeed, in comparison with it, is as a grain compared with the sun, or as a drop in the ocean. In a second, by the power of thought, the soul passes from the abyss to the highest heaven, and from the east to the west. Though on the earth, it knows the latitude of the stars and their distances. It knows the course, the size and the peculiarities of the sun. It knows the nature and cause of the clouds and the rain, the lightning and the thunder. It ensnares the iish from the depths of the sea, and the bird from the end of heaven. By knowledge it subdues the elephant, the camel and the tiger. All these kinds of knowledge, it acquires with its internal and external senses.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The most wonderful thing of all is, that there is a window in the heart from whence it surveys the world. This is called the invisible world, the world of intelli<span class='gtxt_body'>gence, or the spiritual world. People in general look only at the visible world, which is called also the present world, the sensible world and the material world; their knowledge of it also is trivial and limited. And there is also a window in the heart from whence it surveys the intelligible world. There are two arguments to prove that there are such windows in the heart . One of the arguments is derived from dreams. When an individual goes to sleep, these windows remain open aud the individual is able to perceive events which will befall him from the invisible worl&lt;* or from the hidden table of decrees,<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> and the result corresponds exactly with the vision. Or he sees a similitude, and those who are skilled in the science of interpretation of dreams understand the meaning. But the explanation of this science of interpretation would bo too long for this treatise. The heart resembles a pure mirror, you must know, in this particular, that when a man falls asleep, when his senses are closed, and when the heart, free and pure from blameablo affections, is confronted with the preserved tablet, then the tablet reflects upon the heart the real states and hidden forms inscribed upon it. In that state the heart sees most wonderful forms and combinations. But when the heart is not free from impurity, or when, on waking, it busies itself with things of sense, the side towards the tablet will be obscured, and it can view nothing. For, although in sleep the senses are blunted, the imaginative faculty is not, but preserves the forms reflected upon the mirror of the heart. But as the perception does not take place by means of the external senses, but only in the imagination, the heart does not see them with absolute clearness, but sees only a phantom. But in death, as the senses are completely separated and the veil of the body is removed, the heart can contemplate the in</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>visible world and its hidden mysteries, without a veil, just&#39; as lightning or the celestial rays impress the external eye.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The second proof of the existence of these windows in the heart, is that no individual is destitute of these spiritual susceptibilities and of the faculty of thought and reflection. For. instance every individual knows by inspiration, things which he has neither seen nor heard, though he knows not from whence or by what means he understands them. Still, notwithstanding the heart belongs to the invisible world, so long as it is absorbed in the contemplation of the sensible world, it is shut out and restrained from contemplating the invisible and spiritual world.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Think not, thou seeker after the divine mysteries! that the window of the heart is never opened except in sleep and after death. On the coutrary, if a person calls into exercise, in perfection, holy zeal and austerities, and purifies his heart from the defilement of blameable affections, and then sits down in a retired spot, abandons the use of his external senses, and occupies himself with calling out &quot;O God! O God!&quot; his heart will come into harmony with the invisible world, he will no longer receive notions from the material world, and nothing will be present in his heart but the exalted God. In this revelation of the invisible world, the windows of the heart arc opened, and what others may have seen in a dream, he in this state sees in reality. The spirits of angels and prophets are manifested to him and he holds intercourse with them. The hidden things of earth and heaven are uncovered to him, and to whomsoever these things are revealed, mighty wonders are shown, that are beyond description. As the prophet of God says: &quot;I turned towards the earth, and I saw the east and tho west.&quot; And God says in his word: &quot;And thus we caused Abraham to <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Boo </span>tho kingdom of heaven and earth/&quot; which is an example of this kind of revelation.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Probably the knowledge of all the prophets was obtained in this way, for it was not obtained by learning. . . .</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the heart is free from worldly lusts, from the animosities of society and from the distraction occasioned by the senses, the vision of God is possible. And this course is adopted by the Mysties.<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> It is also the path followed by the prophets. But it is permitted also to acquire the practice of it by learning, and this is the way adopted by the theologians. This is also an exalted way, though in comparison with the former, its results are insignificant and contracted. Many distinguished men have attained these revelations by experience and the demonstration of reasoning. Still let every one who fails of obtaining this knowledge either by means of purity of desire or of demonstration of reasoning, take care and not deny its existence to those who are possessed of it, so that they may not be repelled from the low degree they have attained, and their conduct become a snare to them in the way of truth. These things which we have mentioned constitute the wonders of the heart and show its grandenr.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Think not that these discoveries of truth are limited to the prophets alone. On the contrary every man in his esscn&#39;.ial nature is endowed with attributes rendering him capable of participating in the same discoveries. What God says, &quot;Am I not your Lord ?&quot; * refers to this quality. And the holy saying of the prophet of God: &quot;Every man is born with the nature of Islamism; but his ancestors practised Judaism, Nazarenism or Magianism,&quot; is an indication of the same thing.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The heart of man while in the spiritual world know its maker and creator; it had mingled with angels and knew for what service it was created; and in the assembly where thoy said, <span class="gstxt_sup">u</span> Yes,&quot; it was intoxicated as with wine at tho<span class='gtxt_body'>
interrogation, &quot;Am I not your Lord?&quot; As at that moment, it was seen with the eye of certainty, no person had any doubt on the subject, as God says in his holy word: &quot;If you ask them, who created the heavens and the earth, they will answer thee, the wise and holy God.&#39;&#39;i All the prophets were apparently of the same nature as other men without any difference, as wo find in God&#39;s holy word: &quot;Say, I am a man like you: it was revealed to mo.&quot;* Afterwards the heart descended from the world of divino union to this house of separation, from that assembly of love to this station of sorrow, and from the spiritual to the material, and-entering within the curtain of the senses, it became occupied with the care of the body and was overcome by the animal affections and material pleasures. The heart of man, veiled with the garments of heedlessness, forgot the assembly with which it had been familiar, and imagining that this miserable place was to be its mansion of rest, it chose to establish itself here in this world of perdition, as if this was its home. Still the veil of heedlessness disappeared from the eyes of those to whom the grace and guidance of the Eternal and unchangeable gave aid and support, and the discovery of the invisible world was not concealed from tho view of some of those who came into this material world, but was anew revealed to them, after a measure of exertion of spiritual ardor.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>proceeds from him, which transcends what is ordinary, is called a <i>manifestation of grace. </i>The miracle performed by a saint is accounted a miracle of that prophet whose law ho follows. He who has received, by whatever means, a revelation of the invisible world, is capable of being ordained to the office of a prophet. And if he is not appointed by God, tho reason will be either, that at the time the existing law had been newly revealed, and that thcro was no occasion for a prophet, or else that there may be a peculiarity in prophets which is not found in the saints. It follows that it is our duty not to deny either the saintship or the miracles of the saints, but to acknowledge them as real.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>You should be aware, however, that this alchemy of <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness, </span>that is, the knowledge of God, which is the occasion of the revelation of truth, cannot be acquired without spiritual self-denial and effort. Unless a man has reached perfection and the rank of Superior, nothing will be revealed to him, except in cases of special divine grace and merciful providence, and this occurs very rarely. Nor, except by divine condescension, is revelation obtained even by all who by effort reach the rank of Superior. Aud whosoever would attain holiness can only reach it by the path of difficulty.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>You have now learned, student of tho divine mysteries, the dignity of tho heart through knowledge, and what kind of knowledge it possesses. Now listen and learn its dignity through divine power and on account of the greatness of which it is capable, that you may see how precious you are in yourself, and yet how vile and contemptible you make yourself by your own choice. Know then, that the heart is endowed with properties like those of angels and such as are not found in animals; and just as the material world ia subjected by divine permission to tho angels, and when God wills it, tho angels sond forih tho winds, cause rain to<span class='gtxt_body'>
fall, bring forth the embryo in animals, shape their forms, cause seeds to sprout in the earth and plants to grow, many legions of angels being appointed to this service, so also tho heart of man being created with angelic properties must have influence and power over tho material world. In man&#39;s own body, which is peculiarly his own world, its control and influence aro very evident. The hand, for example, does not in writing move of itself, but depends for motion on volition proceeding from the heart. And in eating, it is the heart which by an exertion of its will, causes moisture to rise in the mouth from under the tongue, to mix with the food that it may be swallowed and digested. These facts clearly substantiate tho dominion and control of tho heart, and tho subordination of tho body.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Know also, that if the heart should not bo tarnished with the rust of rebellion, and if the animal and ferocious qualities should not bo dominant, that it would be capable, on account of tho presence in it of angelic properties, of manifesting this same influence over other bodies. If it should look upon a lion or tiger with severity, they would become weak and submissive. If it should look with kindness upon one who is sick, his infirmity might be changed to health. If it should look upon tho vigorous with majesty, they might become infirm. The realty of tho existence of those influences is known both by rcasou and experience. Sorcery with the eyes, is of this kind of power. If for example, a man of a malicious disposition look upon some little thing with envy, and if while he is looking, the destruction of the object should come into his mind, an influence upon it may be observed immediately, and directly or after a while that object will be destroyed: the prophet of God has said: &quot;the eye brings man to the grave and tho camel to the seething pot.&quot;</p>

Although as has been seen, the power of performing signs, miracles and sorceries belongs to the heart when its faculties are in perfect operation, yet there are important destinctions between these powers.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The heart has dominion and control through three channels. One is through visions, by which revelations are made to all men. But the kind of mysteries generally revealed to people in visions, are revealed to prophets and saints in the outward world. The second kind is through the dominion which t-ho heart exercises over its own body, a quality, which is possessed by all men in general, though prophets and saints for the good of the community, possess the same power over other bodies than their own. The third source of dominion of the hcartis through knowledge. The mass of men obtain it by instruction and learning, but it is bestowed by Qod upon prophets and saints directly, without the medinms of learning and instruction. It is possible also for persons of pure minds to acquire a knowledge of some arts and sciences without instruction, and it is also possible that some persons should have all things opened up to them by the wi&#39;l of Qod. This kind of knowledge is called &quot;infused aud illuminated,&quot; as God says in his word: &quot;we have illuminated him with our knowledge.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> These three specialities are all of them found in certain measure in some men, in others two of them are found, and in others, only one is found: but whenever the three are found in the same person, he belongs to the rank of prophets or of the greatest of the saints.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Man cannot comprehend states of being which transcend his own nature. Hence none but the great God himself can comprehend God, aa we have shown in our Commentary upon tho &quot;Names of God.&quot; So also the prophets cannot bo comprehended by any but tho prophets themselves. No person, in short, can understand any individual who belongs to a scale of rank above him. It is possible that there is a peculiarity in prophets, of which no pattern or model is found in other persons, and therefore, we are incapable of understanding them. If we knew not what a vision is, and an individual should say to us, that a man, at a moment when he can neither move, see or hear, cau perceive events which are to occur at a future period, and yet might not be able to perceive the same while walking, listening or looking, we should not in any wise be able to persuade ourselves of the truth of it, as God says in his Holy word: &quot;They treat as a lie that which they cannot comprehend with their knowledge.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> And you, do you not see that he who comes blind into the world, does not understand the pleasure which is derived from seeing?

<p class='gtxt_body'>a lnmlrance in the journey to the truth. Take care and do not. deny that they arc correct in what they say. For, external knowledge is derived from the sensuous world, and all objects of sense are a hindrance to him who is occupied with spiritual truth; for whoever is attending to sensual objects, indicates that his mind is preoccupied with external properties. And it is impossible that he who would walk in the way of truth, should bo for a moment unemployed in meditation, upon obtaining spiritual union and tho vision of beauty.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, student of tho divine mysteries, that the heart is like a reservoir into which five streams flow: these streams at one time run clear, and at another, turbid, and hence the bottom of the reservoir contains much mud. If a person wish to cleanse the reservoir and to get rid of the mud in the bottom, he must first dam up the course of the running streams, and then stir up and put in motion the mud, aud until the muddy water has been carried oft&#39; by the pure water that gushes up at the bottom of the reservoir, he will not allow any other water to run in. Now the external senses resemble those running streams, from which various kinds of knowledge, notions and prejudices proceed to the heart, of which some are pure aud purifying, and some are corrupt and corrupting, and until these have been dammed up, the windows of the heart cannot be uncovered so that the illuminating knowledge from God can be revealed to it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If a person possessing great knowledge of the outward world, should use his knowledge as a means of progress in the way of truth, instead of being satisfied with such disputes as of buying and soiling, marrying and divorcing, and should bo assiduous in gaining divine knowledge, which is tho cud of all other knowledge, it is all well and good. His knowledge of the outward world will give him strength in his course, and will serve as a guide to him in<span class='gtxt_body'>
thu way In eternal truth. For if tho pilgrim do not midcrstnnd the grounds of the respect due to, aud the lawfulness of his food and drink, his dwelling and his clothing, if he do not understand the causes which impair or render complete acts of purification and devotion, what has a tendency to give strength to the hlameable affections of the soul, and what is their nature and their remedy, he can derive no advantage from the sciences of spiritual exercise, discovery and revelation. In short to an ignorant pilgrim, the least doubt may operate as a hindrance in his course for many years. If, however, he should fall into a spirit of disputation, and should say, &quot; knowledge implies nothing else than to bo able to study a book and to correct the composition, the punctuation and the declensions,&quot; he will certainly be frustrated from obtaining and discovering inward knowledge, &#8212; that is, he will not attain to the knowledge of God, which is the object of all knowledge, which is the most sublime knowledge, and compared with which all other knowledge is but husks. Therefore, when we hear some good man, who has travelled far on the road of spiritual discovery affirm, that knowledge of the external world, in tho sense which wo at first alluded to, is n hindrance in tho way of truth, wo ought to be careful not to deny the truth of what he says.</span></p>

And when gold in full bags is offered him, he replies: &quot;Shall I turn my attention to gold, when I am dissolving tho philosophers&#39; stone?&quot; And he finishes with being deprived of the gold, and with only hearing the name of the philosophers&#39; stone.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The science then of revelation, or of infused spiritual knowledge, resembles alchemy, and the science of the doctors of the law resembles gold; but it is folly and pure loss not to accept and be satisfied with solid gold, on account of one&#39;s ardor to discover tho philosophers&#39; stone, which latter knowledge is not acquired by one in a thousand.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There is still one further observation that deserves to bo &#8226; made. If a person by tho payment of a thousand pieces of gold, could become master of alchemy, yet the condition of the man who is absolutely master of ten thousand pieces of gold would be better and preferable. And this illustrates the position of the soofees. If a persou follow their method and attain to the knowledge of some things, he still does not equal in excellence, the doctors of the law. Just as we see, that books on alchemy, and students of alchemy are very numerous, while those who are successful are the least of few, so the path of mysticism is sought for by all men, and longed for by all classes of society, yet those who</p>

The greater part of tho notions and fancies of most of tho mysties, which thoy esteem as revelations and mysteries, are nothing hut vain triflings and pure self complacency; just as that while visions are areality, still mere confused dreams are very abundant. The mystic, however, who by spiritual revelation has learned all that a doctor of the law has becu ablo to learn after many years of study, and who has no remaining doubts in matters of internal or external knowledge, is certainly more excellent than the doctor of the law who is learned only in external knowledge, and this should not bo denied. And it follows that tho way of tho inyHlics in nut be acknowledged to boa Into one, and that you must not destroy the belief of those weak minded and vain persons who follow them; for, tho reasou why they cast reproaches upon knowledge and calumniate the doctors of law is that they have no acquirements or knowledge themselves.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O, inquirer after divine mysteries! do yon ask how it is known that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>of man consists in the knowledge of God, and that his enjoyment consists in the love of God? We observe in reply, that every man&#39;s <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>is found in the place where he obtains enjoyment and tranquility. Thus sensual enjoyment is found in eating and drinking and the like. The enjoyment of anger is derived from taking revenge and from violence. The enjoyment of the eye consists in the view of correct images and agreeablo objects. The enjoyment of the oar is secured in listening to harmonious voices. In tho same way tho enjoyment of the heart depends upon its being employed in that for which it was created, in learning to know every thing in its reality and truth. Hence, every man glories in what he knows, even if the thing is but of little importance, He<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Now that it is clear that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>of the heart consists in the knowledge and love of God, we may say that the heart that does not feel the necessity of the knowledge of God, and a longing for tho lovo of God, but rather craves after and seeks tho world, rcsembles a sick person who has no appetite for food, but even prefers such things as earth and clay to moat, regarding them as necessary, notwithstanding they have no nourishing qualities. If no romedy can be found, speedily, to recover his appetite for food, and if he continue indulging in perverse notions of what is necessary, his malady will grow in strength; until if he continue in this state, he will perish and lose the joys this world can give. In the same manner the heart which does not feel a necessity for the knowledge and love of God, and where the love of other objects reigns, is a heart that is sick and ready to perish, unless a remedy be applied, unless its affections be turned away from other things, and the love of God become predominant. Future bliss will be lost and eternal misery will be its portion. Our refuge is in God!</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>You should know also that the enjoyments of this world that arc procured through the senses are cut off at death. The enjoyment of the love and knowledge of God, which depends upon the heart, is alone lasting. At death the hindrances that result from the presence of the external senses being removed, the light and brilliancy of the heart come to have full play, and it feels the necessity of the vision of beauty.

<p class='gtxt_body'>While the heart is one of the pillars of man, the body is another pillar. In the constitution of man&#39;s body, there is an infinity of most wonderful things to bo observed. Each internal and external organ has various curious uses, of which man is entirely uninformed. Know, that in tho body of a man there arc thousands of veins and nerves: there aro many bones, each of a particular shape and each one created for a particular purpose aud effect. You are ignorant of all this, and you only know that the hand was formed to take bold with, the foot to walk with, and the tongue to speak with. But in reference to the hand, you know nothing about its blood, its bones, the number of its nerves and veins, and the uses of each one: nor in reference to the eye, do you know that it is composed of ten layors, nor of what tho layers aro composed, nor what is tho use of them. And if the eye should meet with an injury in one of the layers, you could not tell the cause of it. You know nothing cither of the internal organs in the belly, such as the spleen, the liver, tho gall-bladder and the kidneys. While these have been given to you to perform functions in which they are continually engaged, you are entirely unconcerned about it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Know then, beloved, that the varieties of food you eat descend to the stomach, and thence to the liver, and that in the liver they are mixed and brought to the form of blood. Upon the liver may be seen something black and frothy which is called black bile. Tho spleen attracts the black bile and changes it into itself. The blood being still mixed with water, has no consistence, and the kidneys draw the water from the blood and purify it. This blood is then diffused to the seven parts of the body, and brings and conveys strength to the limbs. If the spleen become affected with any disorder, so that it ca&#39;uuot separate the black bile<span class='gtxt_body'>
from the blood, such diseases ns leprosy, insanity, inflammation of the spleen and remittent fever aro tho consequence. If any derangement happen to tho gall-bladder so that it cannot secrete tho bile, bilious disorders follow. If tho kidneys get disordered, so that thoy cannot abstract tho wator from tho blood, dropsy and similar diseases are tho result. It all dopends, howover, on tho will of Hod. In tho samo manner, all tho organs of tho body have a specific function. If it were not so, the body would perish. . . .</span></p>

Listen now for a moment candidly. If you had a servant who had been faithful to you during bis whole life, with whose services you were not able to dispense, while he could at any time find a better master&#8212;yet if ho should only for a single day disobey your orders, you would get angry, beat him, and wish to get rid of him.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The scienco of tho structure of the body is called anatomy: it is n great science, but most men arc heedless of it. If any study it,it is only for the purpose of acquiring skill in medicine, and not for the sake of becoming acquainted with the perfection of the power of God. But whoever will occupy himself with anatomy, and therein contemplate the wonders of tho works of God, will reap three advantages. The first advantage will be, that in learning the composition of the thing made, and thereby gaining a comprehensive and condensed view of all other things like it he will see that it is impossible to discover imperfection or incompetence in tho being who has created him in such perfection. Tho Creator himself will bo acknowledged to bo almighty and perfect. The second advantage will be, that ho will seo that it is impossible that a being who has created an organization so intelligent, capable of comprehension, endowed with beauty, and useful, should be otherwise than perfect in knowledge himself. And lastly, we shall understand the mercy, favor and perfect, compassion of God towards us. Nothing that is either useful or ornamental has been omitted in the framing of our bodies, -whether it be such things as are the sources of life, like the spirit and the head; or such as sustain life, as the hand, the foot, the mouth and the teeth: or such as are a means of ornament, as the beard, elegance of form, black hair and the lips. It is to be observed that similar organs have been provided not only for man, but for all creatures, so that nothing is wanting to initiate and sustain life in the mouse, the wasp, the snake and the ant.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Thc knowledge of anatomy is the means by which wc become acquainted with animal life: by means of knowledge of animal life, we may acquire a knowledge of the heart, and the knowledge of the heart is a key to tho knowledges of God. But the knowledge which we obtain of God is limited and contracted in comparison with tho knowledge which tho heart has of itself. Tho knowledge possessed by the heart in comparison with the knowledge of God himself, is but as an atom when compared with the sun.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The body is but an animal to be ridden by the heart, which is its rider, while the heart&#39;s chief end is to acquire a knowledge of God. The dignity of auy thing depends upon what it is in itself. A person therefore who does not understand his own body, heart and soul, and yet pretends to the knowledge of God, resembles the bankrupt, who, although he has nothing to eat himself, should yet plan a feast for all the poor of the city. In short, man ought to make every possible exertion to gain tho knowledge of God, bocauso tho knowlodgo of God necessitates tho lovo of God. Just in the same manner as when you see a beautiful specimen of calligraphy or some elegant verses, you praise the person who made them, you feel a love for him in your heart and desire eagerly to see him.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Since you have learned, O inquirer after the divine mysteries, the dignity and nobleness of the heart, know also that this precious jewel has been confided to you and wrapped in a veil, that you may preserve it from too close a contact with the world, and may lead it to perfection and to its place of rest, making it a partaker of manifest <span class="gstxt_hlt">happi</span>ness in the eternal mansions. In the house of rennion you will have reached an eternal rest, where no evil enters, a joy where no pain mingles, a strength without infirmity, <i>a </i>knowledge without doubt, and a vision of the Lord, the enjoyment of which shall be endless.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the heart strive not after its own glory and dignity, but<span class='gtxt_body'>
inclines to the cares of the world and sensual pleasures, no crcnturo is more feeble, infirm and contemptible than man. At one time he will be the slave of disappointment and melancholy, at another suffering from disease and misfortune; at one time exposed to hunger and thirst, and at another the slave of avarice or ambition. He is not indulged with the enjoyment of a single day in peace. And when he is disposed to partake of the pleasures of the world and stretches out his hand to them, for a long time he cannot succeed in freeing himself from calamity. Even the pleasure of eating will be attended with oppression and pain, and afterwards be followed by some adverse accident. In short, of whatever enjoyment he partakes, regret is sure to follow it. If we regard knowledge, power, will, beauty and grace of form as constituting the glory and honor of this world, what is the wisdom of man? If his head pain him, he knows not the cause or the remedy. If he have pain at his heart, he knows not the occasion of it, or why it increases, or what will cure it. He sees the plants and medicines that could cure it, perhaps even holds them in his hands, and is not aware of it. He knows nothing of what will happen to him on the morrow, nor what action will be a source of enjoyment to him, nor what will be to him a source of pain. If you look only to the strength of a man, what is more impotent than he is. If a fly or mosquito molest him, he cannot get rid of it. If he is attacked by disease, he has no remedy to meet it with. He has no power to preserve himself from destruction. If you look at the firmness and resolution of man, what is more contemptible than he is! If he see any thing more extraordinary than a piece of money, he changes color and loses his presence of mind. If a beggar meet him, he turns away, and dares not look him in the face. If you look at the form of man, you see that it is skin, drawn over blood and impurity. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Beloved, in proportion as a man analyzes tho nature of his body and the variety of uses of its several members, his reverenco and lovo for its Creator and Maker will increase. Let a man observe, for example, that his hands are ruado like columns and separated from the body, to serve as an instrument to seize, or take hold of, or to defend it from an enemy. At the extremity of the hands are five fingers, four of which are in a row, and some long and some short, so that when they tako hold of anything, they may como equally together in the palm of the hand. Tho thumb, -which is opposite to the four fingers, is shorter than any of them and stronger, that it may bo n help to the whole and render them capable of retaining and grasping. The four fingers have three joints each, and the thumb has but two, that when contracted they may bocomo like the bowl of a spoon or ladle, and that when open they may become like a plate, and so discharge an infinity of services. The front teeth were formed sharp, to cut and separate the food: the side teeth were formed broad to mash and grind the food. The tongue was formed like a spoon to throw the food into the throat . There is, also, under the tongue, an organ by which water is poured put, and the food is mado of the consistence of dough, that it may ho moro easily swallowed and digoHtod. All tho organs, in short, have been devised with tho best arrangement and form for use, and each one of them is punctual day and night in discharging its function. Think not, that they are lazy or sleeping. If the minds of the intelligent, the science of the learned, and the wisdom of the sage had been united and had been employed since the beginning of the world, in reflection and contrivance, they could not have discovered anything more excellent than the present arrange</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>ment, nor any forms more useful and beautiful. If the eye had been attached to the top of the head, or the ear to the nape of the neck, or the mouth to the back of the body, or if thrco fingers had been given instead of four, it is plain to a person of intelligence that the existing advantages would not havo been secured, and tho present beauty of form and appearance would have been imperfect.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Let us notice, also, the daily necessities of man, his need of food, of clothing and of a dwelling; his need of rain, clouds, wind, heat and cold: and that he needs the weaver, the cotton-spinner, the clothier and the fuller to provide him with clothing; and that each one of these has need of so many instruments, and of so many trades, like those of the blacksmith, the farmer, the carpenter, the dyer, and the tanner; and besides, their need of iron, lead, wood and the like. Notice at the same time, the adaptation of these workmen to their instruments, and of the instruments to tho trades, and how ouch art has given rise to sovcral others, and tho mind is nstonishod and distracted. Tho adaptation of all these instruments comes from the pure grace and perfect mercy of God, and from the fountain of his benevolence. Moreover, God&#39;s creating prophets, sending them to us, and leading us to their law and to love them, is a perfume of His universal beneficence. He proclaims himself, &quot; My mercy surpasses my anger,&quot; and the Prophet has said: &quot;Verily, God is more full of compassion to his servants, than the affectionate mother to her nursing child.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It has been shown that man from his own existence, knows tho existence of his creator, that from his analysis of the materials of which his body is composed and of its distinctive characters he understands the almighty power of God, that from the uses, the arrangement and the combination of his organs, he knows the omniscient wisdom of God, and that his clemency and compassion extend to<span class='gtxt_body'>
all. He knows, also, that these many mercies and bounties aro bestowed upon him without his seeking or care, from God&#39;s rich and overflowing grace. Now in this way it is possible that the knowledge of the soul should become the key to the knowledge of God. For just as from a survey of your own being and attributes, you havo in a contracted form learned the being and attributes of God, it is also possible to understand how the freedom and the holiness of God, bear a resemblance to the freedom of your soul.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, that God exists exempt from and independent of the notions that enter the mind, and the forms that aro produced in the imagination, that ho is not subjected to reasoning, and time and place cannot bo ascribed to him. Still his exercise of power and (ho manifestation of his glory are not independent of place. Dnt in the same manlier, this independence and freedom is possible in your soul. Tho spirit, for example, which wo call heart is exempt from the entrance of fancies and imaginations, and also from size and divisibility. Nor has it form or color, for if it had, it could be, seen by the eye, and would enter into the sphere of fancy and imagination, and its beauty or ugliness, its greatness or littleness would bo known. If any one ask you about your soul, you may answer, &quot;It exists by the will of God: it has neither quantity or physical quality; it is exempt from being known.&quot; Beloved, since you are incapable of knowing the spirit which is in your body, how should it bo possible for you to know God, who created spirits, bodies and all things, who is himself foreign to all of them, and who is not of their class and kind? It is one of the most important things, yea, a most necessary duty, to treat of God as holy, independent and free.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>How many things there are in your body in reference to which you do not know their reality and essence, such as<span class='gtxt_body'>
desire, love, misery and pleasure. Their existence is admitted, but their quantity and quality cannot be measured. If you desire to learn the absoluto truth about them, yon cherish a vain longing; and it is the same, if you desire to know the absolute nature of voice, nutrition or hearing. As that which is perceived by the eye has no relation to voice, and as that which is perceived by the ear has no relation to form, and as that which is perceived by tho sense of smelling has no relation to taste, so that tho one can be known by means of the other, in the same manner that which is perceived through the medinm of tho mind or of divine power, cannot be perceived by tho senses. Again, as the spirit exists and controls the body, and yet we know not the mode and essence of it, so God is present in all things, and controls and governs all things, but his form, essence and quality are exempt from being known. Exemption and freedom may be illustrated in still another manner. In the same way that the spirit pervades all the limbs and the body, and the body is entirely subject to its control, and that tho spirit is indivisible, while tho body 18 divisible, so also in relation to God, all that exists, springs from him, all creatures exist by his word, and in all possible things his operations are seen, yet still he is not related to place, nor does he reason about anything, and he is free from relation or affinity to any quality of bodies or to quantity.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>And now, student of the divine mysteries, that you have in general understood, as far as your mind can reach, the being and attributes of God, by having your own soul as an example, it is important that you should become acquainted with the influence of the word, government and sovereignty of God in the world. This is called <i>knowledge of operation. </i>You ought to understand, also, as tar as reason can go, tho government that he exercises over tho body, so that you may comprehend in what way creatures obey the word and the will of God, in what way the angels by his decree convey their ministrations from heaven to earth, in what way the movements of the heavens and the revolutions of the constellations are effected, and what is the key to the method by which the orders of demons arc effected. But unless you know in what way you exercise authority over your body, what probability is there that you can understand bow God exercises control over all things.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>&quot;Know thyself, and thou shalt know thy Lord.&quot; Observe then that when you desire to write upon paper tho phrase, <i>In the name of God, </i>there arises first of all an inclination and a decision in the heart to write it. Next in order, that inclination and decision by means of the animal spirit is carried to the brain. When that decision has reached the brain then tho imago of the phrase, <i>In the name of God </i>is formed in the faculty of imagination in the brain. Afterwards tho imago reaches a nerve resembling a white thread, and descends by means of it to tho cuds of tho lingers. Finally by means of tho senses the fingers write tho phrase <i>la the name of Goil, </i>in tho form in which by tho will of tho heart, it exists in tho treasury of &#39;tho imagination. Again, also, when tho will of God is bUKpcudud to anything, a lukou uf it rides aud appears in<span class='gtxt_body'>
the empyreal heaven. And tbcrc is fin essence called both Hie Spirit of Power, and the Holy Spirit, by means of which it arrives at thc throno in the heavens. As the phrase, <i>In the -name of God, </i>appears in thc treasury of the imagination, so the image of the thing dependent on the will of God appears upon the Preserved Tablet. The angels appointed to serve in the empyrean and at the throne, cause it to descend to the inferior world, and by means of the periods and hours of the constellations, it is made to appear through the four elementary qualities &#8212; heat, cold, moisture and dryness. As the phrase <i>In the name of God </i>is written down by first dipping the pen in the ink, so the thing which God wills, comes to light by mixing heat and cold with water and earth. As paper is so adapted to writing as to preserve the forms which are written upon it, so dryness and moisture arc recipient of those other forms and preserve the images that are produced. If moisture did not exist, forms aml images could not bo preserved. In tho name manner as by the will of the heart and by the method above mentioned, the image <i>In the name, of God, </i>which is in the treasury of tho imagination is painted with the pen Upon paper, <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Ho </span>also the will of God, which is an imago produced upon tho Preserved Tablet in tho empyrean, la produced and made visible in the material world, by means of tho angels, the constellations and the elemental qualities of water ami earth.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At the time when the heart of man had control over all tho organs and members, and they were all obedient to it, some thought that man was a dweller in his own heart. When tho empyrean in like manner, ruled over all things by the will of God, they reasoned that man was seated in tho empyrean.

Thanks and praises be given to him who is without beginning mid eternal, to him who is unceasingly beneficent, tohitu who nutdo you sovereign over yourself, who subjected your body to you for n kingdom, who made your heart to be an empyreal throne, and made the animal spirit which is tho fountain of Iho heart, to be a seraphic messenger.

He appointed the fingers and the pen to serve the elemental qualities of nature, and subjected them to your order. He made you more excellent and noble than all other creatures, and to exercise rule over all possible things. He has bidden you to beware and not to be heedless of your soul, which is your kindoin and dominion: for to be regardless of your soul, is to be regardless of your Creator and Benefactor.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, however, that thcre is an immenso distance and wide interval between pereeiving the beauty of the Lord, and understanding that which constitutes its soul, marrow and essence. O seeker of the divine mysteries, those impotent astrologers and physicists, who, shut out from the knowledge of God, ascribe changes and events to tho stars and to nature, resemble an ant, that seeing a peu making marks upon paper, should be overjoyed and cry out, &quot; I have found out the secret of the effect. It is tho pen that causes the marks.&quot; This class of men in another point resembles tho natural man, who ascribes .the influences in nature to heat and cold, water and earth: so a second ant looking on with attention, sees that tho pen does not move of itself, but rather by the will of tho hand: mid he turns and says to the iirst ant, &quot; You were mistaken; you did not pereeive the real nature of the thing: you thought the marks and movements were caused by the peu. It is not so; the whole influence proceeds from the fingers and the pen is subject to the fingers,&quot; Beloved, this aut resembles the astrologer, who ascribes effects to the constellations, He does not know that he also is mistaken, and that tho stars and the constellations are subject to the angels, and that the angels can do nothing without the command of (J&#39;od.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the same manner as there is falsity, in the way in which tho material world is regarded by the natural man and the astrologer, there is also a diversity of views among those who survey the spiritual world. There are some who, just as they are upon the point of entering upon the vision of tho spiritual world, seeing that they discover nothing, descend back to their old sphere. There is also a difference of viow between those who do succeed in reaching tho spiritual or invisible world by meditation, for some have an immenso amount of light veiled from them.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Still the miscrablo naturalist, who ascribes effects totho influences of nature, speaks correctly. For, if natural causes had no operation, the art of medicine would havo been useless, mid the holy law would not have allowed to have recourse to medical treatment. The mistake which the naturalist makes, is that he contracts his sphere of vision, and is like the lame ass, that left his load at the first stopping place. He does not know that nature also is subjected to the hand of the power of God, and is a kind of humble servant, such as a shoe is to the ass. The astrologer also says, that the sun is a star, which causes heat and light upon the earth. If there had been no sun, the distinction between day and night would not have existed, and vegetables and grain could not have been produced. The moon also is a star, and if there had been no moon, how many things connected with the requirements of the Law of the Koran, would have been impracticable, such as fasting, alms and i&#39;&#39;<span class="gstxt_sub">b</span>.-image, since there would have been no distinction of weeks, months and years.

And the school of astrologers is to he credited in these representations; hut when they ascribe all events to influences proceeding from the heavenly bodies, they arc liars. They do not perceive that they all alike are subject to tho almighty power of God as God says in his word: &quot;And the sun, moon and stars aro subject to his command.&quot;i There is also an influence exercised by tho stars, which resembles the control, exercised by the ncrvo that comes from the brain over the finger in writing; while tho force of nature is like the control excited upon the pen by the linger. ...</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the health of a person undergoes a change, and he becomes the prey of melancholy and suspicion, and tho pleasures of tho world become distasteful, so that from disgust with it, ho withdraws from all society, his physician eays, &quot;this person is diseased with melancholy; he must take an infusion of dodder, of thyme and bark of endive as a medicine.&quot; The naturalist says: &quot;As this person&#39;s malady i.s of a dry nature, it arises from a predominance ot dryness, which has settled on the brain. Tho occasion of his having a dry temperament is tho season of winter. Until spring comes, and dry weather predominates, there is no possibility of a cure.&quot; The astrologer says, &quot;this person being under tho influence of melancholy, which arises from a hurtful conjunction between Mars and Jupiter, there will he no favorable change in his health until the- conjunction of Jupiter with Venus shall have reached the Trine.&quot; Now know, beloved, that the language of all these persons is correct, for they all speak and belicvo according to tho degree and reach of their reason and understanding. However, the real and essential cause of tho malady may bo stated thus. When fortune is favorable to any person, and tho Deity desires to guide him into the<span class='gtxt_body'>
possession of it, he deputes two powerful ministers to that effect, Jupiter and Mars. These in turn, control the light footed ministers, the elements, and command dryness, for example, to fasten its bridle to the neck of the person, and cause dryness to attack his head and brain. lie is thus made to become weary of the world by means of the scourgo of melancholy and suspicion, and so with the bridle of the will may be impelled towards the Deity. These cireumstances can never be understood in this seuso, cither by medicine, or by nature, or by the stars. One may, however, learn to understand them by knowledge and the prophetic power combined. For they embrace the whole kingdom of the universe with its deputies and servants, and possess the knowledge of the end for which everything was created: they know to whose command all things arc subjected, to what men are invited and what they are forbidden to do.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O seeker after the divine secrets, now that you have learned that within the body of man, there is a sovereign who possesses and controls it, it is time that you should learn the meaning of the sentences, &quot;Glory to God,&quot; &quot;God bo praised,&quot; &quot; There is no God but God,&quot; and &quot; God is tho greatest.&quot; These sentences are very current ou the tongues of men, but they do uot know tho signification of them.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Although these four sentences are in appearance very short, yet there are no others that embrace so much of the knowledge of God. Since from the consideration of the freedom and independence of your own spirit, you have learned the freedom and independence of God, you have in consequence learned the meaning and import of the sentence, &quot;Glory to God.&quot; Seeing that from the sovereignty which you exereise over your own spirit, you have learned the sovereignty which God exereises, and know that all causes and instruments are subject to his power, and that all outward and inward mereies, which are incalculable and innumerable, are from him, you therefore know the meaning and import of the phrase,&quot; God be praised.&quot; As you know also that all things are of his creation, that his government extends over all things, and that without his will no motion or change can affect any thing, you sec the meaning of the words, &quot; There is no God but God.&quot; Listen now to tho explanation of tho sentence, &quot; God is tho greatest.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>.Do not suppose that, from all that has hitherto been said, you can understand tho greatness of God. His greatness and power are above and beyond tho comprehension of tho mind and wisdom of man. Moreover the phraso &quot;God is the greatest&quot; does not mean that God is larger than other things: it is a sin to indulge in such a belief. It is as much as to say, that there are large things, but that God is larger than they are. The holy meaning of the phraso &quot; God is the greatest&quot; is that God is so great, that he cannot be known or comprehended by tho mind or understanding, or be compared with any thing,&#8212;that the&quot; knowledge of God cannot be attained by means of the knowledge which a man has of his own soul (which God forbid!), that <i>a </i>knowledge of his attributes cannot be attained from a knowledge of tho attributes of man, and that his independence and holiness cannot be compared with the independence and holiness of man in any form whatever. God<span class='gtxt_body'>
forbid that His sovereignty and government should be compared and measured! The doctors of the law have been allowed however, in the way of illustration to explain in a certain degree the knowledge, power, excellence and sovereignty of God to man, who is frail and weak in understanding.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Thus, let us suppose that a person had been born and brought up in darkness, where he had never seen the rays or liglrt of the suu, but had merely heard a description of the sun. If such a persou should ask to have the light and mode of shining of the sun explained to him, how would it be possible in any way to explain to him what it is? If however, there should happen to be in that dark placo many glow worms, the persou addressed, taking one of them up in his hands, might say, &quot; the light of the sun resembles this,&quot; although in reality it has not a particle or an atom of resemblance. Take another example: suppose a child incapable of making distinctions, should inquire of us about the pleasure derived from exorcising authority and sovereignty. We, knowing the impossibility of explaining the matter to him, might answer that the pleasure of ruling was like that obtained from playing with nuts or at ball, although it does not resemble them in any particular. From these examples we may learn that it is impossible for any being, except God himself, to know God. &quot;God is witness! God is witness! No one knows God, except God himself.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Finally, seeker after divine mysteries, know that the paths to the knowledge of God, are as numerous as the souls of creatures, and their number is known to God alone.

We now proceed to observe, that it is an argument to prove that the <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>of man consists in obedience and devotion, the fact that when a man dies, his destination is to return to where God is. Every thing which concerns man is with God, and his works will all be presented before Him. Whenever all the affairs of a person arc in the hands of another, and his employments and his homo arc with him &#8212;when he is near to him and continually has need of him, there will bo perfect harmony between the two, and abiding friendship and love. Whoever be the person whom we love, we shall find our <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>with him. There is nothing more delightful than to meet with and look upon an object that we love. But we ought to know that the love of God will, never reign in the heart of a man until first the knowledge of God reigns there, and until the remembrance of God becomes unceasing. If one individual love another, he is continually thinking of him, and by this continual remembrance, his love is increased.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Those t. reless and indifferent persons, 0 seeker after the divine mysteries, who from ignorance, stupidity and sin have turned away from God.and his prophet, and have wandered from tho path of religion, may be arranged in seven classes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To the first class belong those who do not believe in God. They had.desired to find him out in his essence and attributes, by speculations and fancies, by comparisons and illustrations. And because they have not succeeded in understanding bim, they have referred his acts and his government to the stars and to nature. They have fancied that the soul of man and of other animals, and this wonderful world with its marvellous arrangements came of themselves, and that they are eternal; or that they are effects from natural causes, and that there is no creator beyond the sphere of tho world. This class of people resembles the man who seeing a writing, fancies that it was written of itself, and infers that it was not written by a penman or by a supernatural power: or else that it is eternal and that no one knows whence it tomes. It is impossible to recover from<span class='gtxt_body'>
the i&gt;nth of delusion, persons whoso ignorance, orror and stupidity huvo reached such &#187; degree ns this.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tho second class of crrorists are those who deny a day of resurrection and assembly. They allege that man and other animals are like vegetables, and do not enter into another body when they die. They say, that a resurrection, in which, spirits and bodies shall be reassembled in one place, is impossible, and that there will be neither discipline or punishment, recompense or reward. The errors of this sect arise from their inability to understand of themselves their own souls. They imagine that the spirit is an animal spirit only, and that the heart, which is in reality the spirit of man, is the place for the knowledge of God, and that no evil can happen to it, except that it will be separated from the body. They call this separation, death. This sect is unconcerned about this spirit, and in proof of this we shall discourse, if it please God, in the fourth chapter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The third class of errorists are those who indeed believe in God aud a future life, but whose faith is weak, because they do not understand the requirements of the law. They say that &quot; God is able to do without our worship. There is neither any profit to God from our worship, or any injury dono him by our disobedience. If wo worship God, wo shall learn what good it did in the future world; and if wo do not worship him, there will neither bo any advantage or harm. God himself so declares in his holy word,&quot; Whosoever keep himself pure, does it for his own advantage,&quot;&#39; aud in another place, &quot;He who does well, does it for his own profit.&quot; * Although it is better to worship God, yet as God has no need of our worship, therefore if we do not worship him, what harm is there in it?&quot; These ignorant people resemble tho sick man, who when the physician says to him, &quot;you should be abstinent, if you wish to be</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>cured of your malady,&quot; should answer, &quot;what advantago Is it to you whether I am abstinent or not&quot;? Now though tho sick man is right when ho says that there is no advantage to the physician from his abstinence, yet if he is not abstinent, he will perish. This class regards obedience and transgression as of the samo degree in value. But in the same manner as disease may occasion a man&#39;s destruction, so transgression defiles the heart, and will cause it to appear in the future world in a state of woe. And just as abstinence and medicine.restore tho body to health, so to avoid acts of transgression and sin and to bo obedient to God, arc means of securing salvation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fourth class of men who indulgo in error, are those. who indeed receive tho law, but in some peculiar and erroneous sense. They wrongly say,&quot; The law commands us to keep our hearts pure from pride, envy, hatred, anger and dissimulation. But this is a thing which it is impossible to do. For the soul has been created with these qualities and affections, and human nature cannot be changed. It is just as impossible to make a black material whito by scraping it, as for the human heart to be free from these qualities.&quot; These ignorant men do not know and understand, that tho law does not command that those qualities should bo entirely etlaeod and expelled from tho heart, but rather requires that they should be brought under subjection to the heart and the reason, to the end that they may not act presumptuously, go beyond the limits set by the law, and indulge in mortal sins. It is possible even to change these qualities, by doing only what reason requires, and by respecting the restrictions of the law. Many devout men in past times have secured this change of the affections of the soul. These qualities once existed in the prophet of God, but they were corrected, as we learn from the tradition: &quot;I am a man like you. I become angry, as a man becomes angry.&quot; And God speaks in his holy word of<span class='gtxt_body'>
&quot;those who control thoir wrath, and who pardon the men who oftbnd them.&quot; i Notice, that in his eternal word, God praises those who disisipitto their anger and irritation: he does not praise thoso who had no anger or rage, since man cannot be without them.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The fifth class of persons in error are those who say that, &quot; God is merciful and ready to pardon, loving and compassionate, and more pitiful to his servants than a father and mother to their children, and therefore he will pardon our faults and cover our transgressions.&quot; They do not consider that notwithstanding God is bounteous and merciful, there arc still multitudes of poor and miserable people in the world, multitudes who are infirm and helpless, and many who are subjected to suffering. This is a mystery which is known only to God. But it stows us, that though God is disposed to cover and hido sin, still he is an absolute sovereign and an avenger. While he is bounteous and beneficent, he is at the same time dreadful in his chastisements: while he is a benefactor, and provides the necessaries of life, at the same time he who does not seek to gain, obtains no store: and he who is not industrious, accomplishes nothing in the world. Beloved, these ignorant men, in the affairs of the world, in their schemes of living, and in their business, manifest no trust in the bounty of God, nor do they leave off for one moment their buying and selling, their trades or their farming, although God has decreed the means of their existence many years before they were born, and has made himself surety that it should be provided for thorn, He announces in his eternal word and book of mighty distinctions, that &quot; there is no creature ou the earth, for whom God has not taken upon himself to provide nourishment.&quot;&#39; Still they make not the least exertion in reference to thoir relations aud condition in ctor</p>

But they arc not aware that Satan is deceiving them with it, hindering them from obedience and worship, and preventing them from engaging in that cultivation and commeree that would prepare them for eternity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The sixth class who indulge in error, are those who, exalted with pride, think that they have already attained and are perfect: and they say, &quot; we have reached such a state that transgressions do us no harm: we are like the sea, which is not polluted by filth falling into it.&quot; These foolish people are so ignorant, that they do not know that&quot; to be like the sea,&quot; means to attain such a degree of calm that no wind can put them in movement and that nothing can cause any perturbation in their minds. These persons on the contrary, if an individual fail to treat them with honor and respect, or if in conversation the individual do not address them as, my lord or dear sir, or speak a word that touches their reputation, they bear him a grudge for a long time, and even perhaps attempt to do him an injury. And if a person take a piece of money or a morsel of bread from them, the world becomes too straight for them, and every thing looks dark. These foolish people have not even yet reached manhood. They are weak in their own souls, and are in subjection like slaves to passion and anger. If it were not so, how could they be so inconsiderate and presumptuous? Beloved, the falsehood and error of these people appear from this consideration.

<p class='gtxt_body'>terate their faults, and to obtain pardon and forgiveness. Filled with fear and dread, they became blind from their tears; from their long continuing perturbation and distraction of mind, you would think they had lost the use of their reason. As for the companions of the prophet, and their immediate successors who were faithful witnesses for the truth and the beloved of God, they were so afraid in their suspiciousness of doing wrong, that they abstained in their anxiety, from doing even what was lawful. Do not these ignoramuses know that their degree of attainment does not equal that of the prophets and apostles, and that they are even at a great distance from them? Why then do they not shrink in fear and awe from the shining vengeance of the glorious God?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If they urge, however, that the transgressions of the prophets were doing them no injury, but that they were exercising prudence and carefulness for the sake of other people, we then reply, that you also ought to be careful, lest other people seeing your actions, should imitate your example. And if they respond, we do not belong to the rank of prophets, that men should walk in our steps, or that any injury should befall us, on account of the sins which they may commit, we would again reply, that it is better that no injury should come to yon in consequence of the sins done from imitating yon, than that injury should not befall tho prophets from the sins done in consequence of imitating them; for they are the praised and accepted servants of God; their earlier and their later sins have been pardoned, and they aro blessed in Paradise. Why, then, was it so necessary that they should abstain from forbidden things, from things of a doubtful nature and even from permitted things? It is said that one day some ripe dates were brought to the prophet, and be took one and put it in his blessed mouth. But immediately a doubt entered his mind, as to the manner in which thedateshad been obtained,<span class='gtxt_body'>
and he took it out of his blessed mouth and would not cat it. On another occasion a cup of milk was brought to the faithful witness Aboo Bekir by his slave, and he took it and drank it. After drinking it, ho inquired,&quot; where did you get the milk?&quot; The slave said, &quot;I told a man his fortune, and he gave me the milk in return.&quot; As soon as the faithful witness heard this, he frowned severely upon his servant, inserted his blessed finger down his mouth, and threw&#39;up the whole of the milk, so that none of it remained on his stomach. He then said, &quot; I fear that if any of the milk should remain on my stomach, God would expel knowledge and love from my heart.&quot; Now what harm could result to other people from their eating those dates or drinking that milk, that they should have been so careful about such little things? And since they did abstain from such little things, regarding them as injurious, how should it be otherwise than injurious to these foolish people to drink wine, in full bowls and even by the jar full?</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>They know that the wisdom, piety and abstinence of the prophets and saints were not less than their own. Can there bo any more astonishing folly than that of these men who dare to compare themselves with the sea, because they are not disturbed by drinking several bowls of wine, while they compare the prophet of God, to a little water, which is changed in its taste by a single date? Thoy are just worthy that Satan should scizo hold of them by the beard and mnstachios, and drag them after him both in this world and tho next, making them a shame and reproach.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Now the faithful, truthful and experienced in religion, who are mindful that tho soul is treacherous, deceptive, perfidious, malicious and false, always watch carefully over their own souls, lest they should do something that transcends the commands of the law, or that is contrary to reason. The soul is always disposed to say to itself, &quot; I am obedient to the truth: I am submissive to the holy law:</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA64'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and I am well instructed in knowledge.&quot; But thon, without being puffed up by this deceitful language of the soul, must constantly look to all its thoughts and states. If it is walking in the path of the law and of the prophets and saints, it is well! and happy is ho that is faithful to his word! But if the soul begin to have an inclination for self-indulgence, to explain away or exceed the limits of the law and to contradict clear and plain knowledge, you must regard it as a machination of the devil and a temptation to the soul. In short, man, until he descends to the grave, must always watch over his soul with attention, to discover in what degree it is obedient to the holy law and in harmony with knowledge. Whoever does not thus watch over and guard himself, is most surely in a delusion and in the&quot; way of a just destruction. It is the first step in Islamisra, that a man should keep his soul subject to the law.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The seventh form of error, beloved, is that of the class whose mistakes arise from ignorance and carelessness, while they have never heard any thing of these doubts of which we have been speaking. They merely wear the garments, cap and quilted robes of the mysties (soofees), and after learning some of their words and phrases, they pretend to have attained saintship and supernatural powers. And although apparently they have no evil intentions, yet because they do not properly respect the holy law, but practice their devotions in a lax way, their course leads them to corrupt doctrines and errors. They are always inclined to do whatsoever their corrupt disposition would lead them to do, such as yielding to the love of frivolous practices, orto sensual indulgences, or assenting to transgression and sin. In the presence of the multitude, they put on aholy mien and do not approve of error and sin, but they do not withdraw their hearts from the pleasure of wine, nor from adulterous and licentious society, nor withdraw their hands from the business of gaining the world. Although iu<span class='gtxt_body'>
these associations there may be no overt sin, yet they do not consider that such thoughts are but satanic suggestions and sensual importunities. They are not capable of distinguishing actions and circumstances, or right and wrong. Beloved, to this class belong those of whom God declares in his holy word,&quot; We have covered their hearts with more than oue envelop, that they may not understand the Koran and we have put deafness upon their cars. Even if thou shouldst call them to the right way, they would never follow it.&quot; 1 It is better to talk with a sword, than to talk with this class of people, for they are not open to conviction. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>portunity to make provision for the future, to acquire knowledge, and to worship God. Man as at first created, was destitute of works, and void of perfection: but he was made capable of reaching perfection and attaining felicity, so that while in a material world he could look forward to a spiritual world, understand whence he came, what are his duties, that he is soon to depart, and might be always ready. Man&#39;s felicity, which consists in the contemplation of the beauty of God, cannot be vouchsafed to him, until the eye of his judgment is opened. But the eye of judgment is opened by the contemplation of the works of God, and by understanding his almighty power. The contemplation of tho works of God is by means of tho senses, which become the key to all knowledge of God. Tho senses subsist by means of the body, and the body is composed of four different elements. Those therefore who are endowed with understanding, conscious of tho frailty of their bodies should make all diligence to quit this kingdom of corruption and to enter permanently into the unchanging kingdom.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, O inquirer after the divine secrets, that there are two things needful to man in this world; first of all, he needs to acquire spiritual food to preserve his heart from perishing. The aliment of the heart consists in the love and knowledge of God; for whatever is a necessity of the nature of any one, that he loves, as we have before mentioned. The ruin of the soul consists in the predominance of some other love over the love of God, which veils the divine love. Our refuge is in God!</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The second thing needful for a man is, that tho body should be preserved and tended with care, since it is the fraino of the heart. As a camel is to a pilgrim, <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Bo </span>the body is like an animal upon which the heart rides. The pilgrim is obliged to give food and water to his camel, and to treat it with attention, that he may reach the end of his journey in safety, and by its moans bo successful in tho<span class='gtxt_body'>
object for which he travels. But the attention bestowed by the pilgrim upon his camel, should be only in that proportion which is really necessary. If he should be busy with his camel day and night, and should expend all his capital in feeding it, he would not reach his destination, but would ultimately become separated from his caravan, would lose all that he possessed, and in view of the injury he had sustained, he would be the victim of unceasing regrets, and ruin would ensue. Just so is it with man in general.&#39; If he pass all his days in attending to the preservation of the body, and spend the capital of his life, in providing food and drink for the body, he will not reach the mansions of felicity, hut will wander in the wilderness of destruction, without capital, penniless and a naked vagabond.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Now the body needs in this world three things, one is food, another is clothing, and the third is a home: and by means of these, it can be preserved from injury and ruin. If the food provided for the body is excessive, the body will be destroyed: but let the food provided for the spirit be ever so much, still is it well. On account, therefore, of man&#39;s need of clothing and food, God has appointed sensuous desire to act as a commissary, that the animal, that is, the body, may not perish from hunger, cold or heat. But as desire, under the control of the animal soul, would not be satisfied with a sufficient quantity, but would crave to spend its life in eating and drinking, God afterwards committed the animal soul into the charge of the reason, that desire might not transgress the proper limits. Yet as the animal soul and desire, on account of their intimate relations with tho body, are so essential to it, their influence would still have been predominant. But God, the holy defender, in accordance with his bounteousuess and grace, (&quot; my merey has surpassed my anger,&quot;) has sent his law by tho tongues of prophets, that it might become strength to tho reason, and prevent the animal soul and desire from<span class='gtxt_body'>
passing beyond the due limits, and on the contrary might dispose the soul to rest satisfied with the degree of energy and force necessary for it, and by learning the design for which it had come into the world, might spend its days accordingly.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>After you have learned, O student of the divine mysteries, what this world in its meaning really is, it is important that you should look at the world in detail. Every thing in the world of matter which grows, has been included under three classes, animal, vegetable and mineral, which arc called the three generations or kingdoms. Animals were created some for riding, some for food, and some for tilling. Vegetables were created to aftbrd food and conveniences to man, and sustenance to various animals. Minerals, like gold, silver, copper and iron, were created to. serve as instruments to provide means of sustaining life in man. It was designed that by means of these three kingdoms, the spirit of man, while dwelling for a few days in the body, should be employed in making preparation for the future world. Man, however, forgetful of the end for which he had come hither, heedless of the fact that he was soon to depart, and that he would then repent to find that he was going unprepared, became engaged in strife with his fellows about the things of the. world, fell in love with its ways, and attempted to gain its wealth. In consequence various qualities began to appear in the heart, such as avarice, envy, ambition and hatred, which are sources of its ruin. Finally the heart, forgetful of the duties for the performance of which it had come into the world, exhausted all its energies in building up the v. orld.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As man&#39;s primary necessities in the world are three, viz: clothing, food and shelter, so the arts of the world are three, viz: weaving, planting and building. The rest of the arts serve either for the purpose of perfecting the others, or for repairing injuries. Thus the spinner aids the work</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>of weaving, the tailor carries out that work to perfection, while the cloth-dresser adds beauty to the work. In the arts, there is need of iron, skins and wood, and for these many instruments are necessary. No person is able to work at all kinds of trades, but by the will of God, upon one is devolved one art and upon another two, and the whole community is made dependent, one- member upon the other. When avarice, ambition and covetousness hold sway in the hearts of men, because some are not pleased to see others obtain honors, and because they do not endeavor to quell their wants, envy and hatred arise among them. Each one, dissatisfied with his own rights, plots against the property and honor of his fellows. On this account there was a necessity for three farther distinctions, viz: sovereignty, judicial authority, and jurisprudence, which contains the digest of the law. But alas.! poor and wretched man coming under the influence of all these causes, motives and instruments, spends his life in collecting wealth and lays up for himself sources of regret. And just as the pilgrim, who on his way to the Kuaba of Mecca, was engaged day and night in taking care of his camel, got separated from the caravan, and perished in the desert, so those who know not the real nature of the world and its worthlessness, and do not understand that it is the place where seed is sown for eternity, but spend all their thoughts upon it, are certainly fascinated and deceived; as the apostle of God declares. &quot;The world is more enchanting than Harout aud Marout: let men beware of it.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>After you have learned that the world is delusive, enchanting aud treacherous, you need to know in what way its delusions aud enchantment operate. I will, therefore, mention some things which are illustrative of the world. The world, beloved, is like an enchanter, who exhibits him<span class='gtxt_body'>self to you as though he would dwell with you and would forever be at your side; while in truth this world is always upon the point of being snatched away from you, notwithstanding you are tranquilly unconscious of it. The world is like a shadow, which, while you look at it, seems fixed, although in reality, it is in motion. Life is like a running water, which is always advancing, yet you think that it is still and permanent, and you wish to fix your abode by it. The world again is like an enchanter who performs for you acts of friendship and manifests love for you, for the sake of winning your affections to him: but as soon as he has secured your love, he turns away his face from you and plots to destroy you. . . .</span></p>

And whenever she has succeeded in inducing a person to follow after her and to decide upon joining himself to her, she takes oft&quot; her robes from her back and her veil from her head, and immediately her concealed ugliness is brought to light, and the person who had been seeking her, becomes subject to eternal regret and sorrow. We have received it also by tradition, that the world will be brought to the great assembly at the last day, in the form of a woman with livid eyes, pendent lips, aud deformed shape, and all the people will look upon her, (wo take refuge in God,) and will exclaim, &quot;what deformed and horrible person is that, whose aspect alone is severe torture to the soul?&quot; And they will be answered. &quot;It was on ber account that you were envying and<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Know, that the world consists of a certain number of stages between the world of spirits and the future world. The first stage is the cradle, and the last is the grave, and every period between these is also a stage. Each month represents a league, each hour a mile, and each breath a step. It is always flowing on like running water. Man in his excessive heedlessness thinking himself to be permanently established,engages in building up the world: and though he has no assurance of a half-hour of time, he makes preparations for dwelling here for many years, and never once brings himself to make the necessary preparation for dislodging and moving to another land.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Behold, another likeness of tho world. Know, beloved, that tho pleasures of tho world, and tho pains and tribulations which are tho counterpart to these pleasures in the future world, resemble the man who should eat very largely of rich and delicate food and find great delight therein: but on account of his excesses, he suffers from indigestion, his stomach is irritated, vomiting and sickness ensue and he has a great deal to endure before he can recover his health. He repents of what he has been eating, and in proportion as he ate extravagantly, and found enjoyment, he now suffers corresponding pain and disappointment. Now then, jn proportion as any one in the world has indulged in the pleasures of life and dissipation, so much the greater will be his anguish and torment at the moment of death. He who possesses gardens and fields, houses, lands, and money, servants and horses, will be subject to regret and affliction at death, in proportion to their amount. This misery does not close with death, but on the contrary after<span class='gtxt_body'>wards increases. The Lord Jcsns (upon whom he peace!) declares that the world is like the man who drinks seawater. The more he drinks, the more his internal heat increases. And unless he stops, he will destroy himself by drinking.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Man in this world resembles the guest who was invited to partake of the hospitality of a rich man. In token of respect, the servants set before him silver washing-basins, vessels of costly stones, perfumes of musk and amber with dialing dishes. The poor guest is &#8226;overjoyed at the sight of these things, thinking that they have been made his own property, and he lays hold of them with the intention of retaining them. The next day, when he is upon the point of departure, they are all taken from him by force, and the measure of his disappointment and regret is clear to every person of discrimination. Seeing that this world is itself a mansion built for travellers, by the road over which they arc to pass, that they may make a halt, and lay in provisions preparatory to leaving it again, he is a wise guest who does not lay his hand upon other things than his necessary provisions, lest on the morrow when about to move on, they take them out of his hands, and he expose himself to regret and sorrow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The people of this world arc also like the passengers in a ship, who while sailing upon the sea, arrive at an island. The sailors draw the ship to the shore, and then call out and say, &quot; whoever wishes for water or other provisions, let him leave the ship and go and procure them: let him not delay, for the ship will not remain long. It is besides a dangerous place, and whoever remains hero will perish.&quot; After receiving this warning, the passengers leave the ship, and are nil scattered about, one in this direction and another in that. The wise passengers, reinsmbcring the admonition of the sailors, attended quickly to their affairs, and immediately returned to the ship. They selected the places in the shif<span class='gtxt_body'>
that pleased them best, and eat down calm and tranquil. Some of the passengers, however, gazed at the trees, the flowers and the fruits of the island, listened to and admired the notes of the birds, and became absorbed in looking at the wonderful curiosities found there. They delayed so long, that when they came to the ship, they found every place in the ship occupied, and no room for them to sit down. They finally entered, and found a corner with great difficulty, where they could just press themselves in. Others, not satisfied with gazing around, loaded themselves with stones that had the appearance of being precious, and after n time returned to the ship. They found it completely full, and absolutely no place to sit down. After they had entered, they were compelled from necessity to stow themselves in a dark place at the bottom. As for the stones which they had thought were jewels, they lost their color, putrefied, and sent forth such a disagreeable odor, as to affect the passengers to nausea. It was impossible to expel the odor and they remained to the last with its disagreeableness in the midst of them. Others still took so much pleasure in looking about the island, that they said to themselves, &quot; where shall we be able to find a more delightful retreat than this <i>1 </i>It is not clear that the place where we are going is better than this.&quot; And so they chose to remain there; and after the departure of the ship some of them perished with hunger and thirst, and some were devoured by wild beasts. Not one of them was saved. In the future world they will certainly suffer pain aud retribution.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If you wish, O student of the mysteries of God, to learn the essential facts about death, you must know that there are in man two kinds of spirit, one of which is of the nature of the spirit in animals and which we call animal spirit, and the other is of the nature of the spirit of angels, which we call human spirit. The fountain of the animal spirit is in that heart which is in the left side of the breast, and is a piece pf flesh. It is a delicate exhalation from the humors within the animal. Its constitution is fixed in certain<span class='gtxt_body'>
proportions, just no is that of oxymel, which is composed of honey and vinegar that on being mixed, while they loso their own flavor, acquire anew, delicate and useful flavor, so also, by the blending of the various elements of the body, a delicate exhalation is the result, which finds its home in the heart. It gains other delicate qualities from the heart, and from thence the blood channels, which are tho veins of pulsation, nre supplied. The exhalation passes by their means to the brain and from thence flows to all the members. It is exceedingly hot, but in its passage to the brain, it loses some of its heat and becomes tepid. By the distribution of this spirit through the body, the eye sees, the ear hears, tho tongue tastes, tho nose smells, and the rest of tho organs are endowed with their proper movements and perform their appropriate functions. . . .</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>So long as the spirit works in equilibrinm, it is capable of delicate operations and effects; but so soon as excess of heat or cold destroys the equilibrinm, tho exhaled fluid is diminished, and it becomes incapable of movement and sensation. &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>That cause which throws tho constitution out of balanco and occasions tho complete absence of the exhalation, is called the Angel of death, who is also n creature of God. Most persons merely know his name. . . .</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The second kind of spirit, which is called both human spirit and heart, is not a body, and is not susceptible of division. It is the scat of the knowledge of God. In the same manner, God himself is one, is not susceptible of separation into parts and the place of his knowledge is one. . . . Even if the action of the larger part of the members should be paralyzed, it is still possible that life should continue in a man. Death occurs, when, after the ruin of the constitution, the delicate exhalation on that very account is no longer transmitted to the members, and they are all<span class='gtxt_body'>
paralyzed together and cease from movement. Although you still remain in being, you possess neither sensation nor motion. You know, also, that in infancy the ingredients of your body were drawn from pure blood. These underwent a change and disappeared, and the ingredients derived from food took their place. You know moreover that the form which you had on your entrance into the world, and your present form are not the same. It follows therefore that there is no necessity of your perishing on account of the perishing of the body. The body is earth and must therefore return to its original earth. Your spirit, however, is of on angelic nature, and you must therefore mingle with your original spirit. If the influences of the world operate with such power that you are separated from your original spirit, it is fixed and sure that you will have to endure the torment of separation and misery, It should be kept in mind, that yon possess two classes of qualities or attributes. One class includes those which result from the union existing between your body and your spirit, viz: hunger, thirst, sleep, eating and drinking. These qualities become useless at death. The other class includes qualities belonging solely to your spirit, such as the knowledge of God, and the love of God, and the qualities which tend to secure these two, as gratitude, submission and supplication. These are qualities of your individual self, which do not pass away with death, but on the contrary the fruits of them will be over growing and developing. The language of the blessed God in the words, &quot;the permanent things are the holy virtues,&quot;&#39; points to these qualities. That spirit is also enduring aud eternal, which is destitute of love and knowledge, which indeed knows nothing and has no delight in or affection for these</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The nature of death cannot be understood, unless we are acquainted with these two kinds of spirit and with the relations of dependence between them. Know, then, O seeker, that the animal spirit belongs to the inferior world. The elements of its four humors, blood, phlegm, bile and black bile, are fire, air, water and earth. The animal spirit is a product of a delicate exhalation from these elements. The variations in the measure of a man&#39;s health depend outhe variations of heat, cold, dryness and moisture. Hence it is the object of the science of medicine to preserve these four elements in their duo proportions, so that they may servo as instruments to noeuro perfection to the human spirit. *</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The human spirit belongs to the superior world and is of an angelic substance. It has come into this world a stranger, and has descended from its original state to this temporary home, to receive its destiny from divine direction, and for the purpose of acquiring the knowledge of God. Iu accordance with this, God declares in his holy word, &quot; Wo said to them &#8212; leave paradise all of you just as you are: a book destined for your guidance will come to you from me: fear shall never befall those who will follow it, and they shall not be afflicted.&quot; * And that which God says in another place, points to the different degrees of worlds: &quot;I create man of clay: and when I shall have formed man of clay and shall have breathed my spirit in him, prostrate yourselves before him in adoration.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> First of all in his saying &quot; from clay &quot; he points to a material body. The phrase &quot;I shall have formed&quot; indicates the animal spirit. The phrase &quot;shall have breathed my spirit<span class='gtxt_body'>
in him,&quot; means that I have given to the body of man a well balanced constitution with power and motion. I have made it capable of receiving the law, and to be a home for the knowledgo of God.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the same manner as the equilibrinm of the inferior spirit is to be preserved by the science of medicine, the equilibrinm of the human spirit is to bo preserved by virtue, self-denial and holy zeal, that it may not bo destitute of the love of God and perish.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is plain, then, that a knowledge of the future world cannot be acquired, until we have learned the true nature of the two spirits. We cannot obtain, for example, a knowledge of God, unless we previously possess a knowledge of the soul. But as Islamism consists essentially in believing and confessing the Lord God and the future world, it becomes our duty to acquire a knowledge of the future world as far as the tiling is possible. There is, however, a mystery regarding the future world, which the holy law has not authorized to bo explained or to be mentioned, because it could not possibly bo understood. Seeing then that the knowledge of the future world cannot possibly be acquired, until that mystery is revealed, strive that it may be revealed in your own soul by pious endeavor, self-denial and divine guidance. You cannot learn it by any possible efforts from any other person by the hearing of the ear. Many poisons have heard this mystery, which represents one of the attributes of God, but they did not acknowledge it as true, and said that it,was impossible, not because it was in its nature exempt from being known, but because it was an unemployed mystery. It is not named either in the Koran or in the Traditions. God commanded the prophets not to inform the people of the essence of his attributes, saying &quot; for they will not understand them, will accuso you of falsehood, and will do injury to themselves.&quot;</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA79'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It has been clearly shown to you, student of the mysteries, that the human spirit in its essence anil attributes is to live forever, and that it is able to exist without a frame, that the meaning of death is not the annihilation of the spirit, but its separation from the body, and that the resurrection and day of assembly do not mean a return to a now existence after annihilation, but the bestowal of a new form or frame to the spirit, which shall bo under its control in the second period, as the body was under its control in the first period. . . .</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In saying that in the second period, the control of the spirit is easy, it is said in respect to our contracted understandings, and in comparison with our operations, and to make the matter intelligible to others. When God says in the powerful Koran, &quot;It is easier,&quot; and &quot; For me it is easy,&quot; he uses the phraseology only for the sake of being understood by man. On the contrary in the first period, there was nothing difficult for God: it would have been nothing to him to have created without matter, in a moment, a thousand worlds like this which we inhabit.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It follows from what has been said, that it is not a necessary condition of the resurrection and restoration that the spirit should possess exactly the original mould. For that which wo seek is not the vehicle of the spirit, but tho spirit itself. This mould undergoes change even in this world. Thus, for example, the materials derived from the condensation of the exhalations and the inspissation of the blood in the stomach of the mother are changed by food, and new fiesh is produced. Many questions may be asked of those who say that the identical mould must return and rise in the resurrection, and that its absence can in no wise be tolerated, and they will find much difficulty in answering them. One may ask for example, if one man cat another man, and tho man eaten become a portion<span class='gtxt_body'>
of the man who ate him, will that portion rise with the cater or with the man who was eaten? . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>They say, moreover, that man is created from seed, that seed is derived from food, and that food is derived from the milk, the fat or the flesh of an animal: .now with which of all these will the ingredient rise u;i? Again, suppose the hand of a thief has been cut oft&#39;, and he afterwards leads a life of good works and enters Paradise. Must he enter Taradise, where nothingmaimed or defective can enter, without his hand, or will ho enter with his hand, notwithstanding his good works were not performed when he possessed that hand? The source of all these perverse speculations is in the pretence of those who say .that in the day of assembly, the mould reappears and that the spirit follows in its train, that if it was not for the mould there would be no semblance of man, and that the permanency of the spirit results from its connection with the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If, 0 seeker, you say that the well known language of the wise in the law and in discourse is, that at death a man becomes non-existent, and that he exists afterwards in the resurrection with this identical body, and that oar language contradicts theirs, we reply. Iie who merely follows in the track of the language used by others, will never acquire a knowledge of the truth. However, the words you lmve cited are not those, cither of people of intelligence or or&#39; imitators. For the intelligent and learned know that t&#39;ie body is not annihilated at death, but that the materials of which it is composed are separated, and that it is &#39;.his separation which they call death. The imitator has likewise hoard from the doctors of the law, that the spirit lives eternally after death.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is well known that spirits are divided into two classes, in one of which all blessed spirits are embraced and in the other all miserable spirits. With respect to the blessed spirits God says,&quot; Think not that those who have been slain on<span class='gtxt_body'>
the divine road are dead: they are alive near their Lord and are sustained by him.&quot; i In regard to the miserable spirits, the apostle of God came to the infidels who had been slain in the battle of Bader,&#39; and called upon each by name, and said, &quot; O! such a one, son of such a one, I have found the victory and trinmph which my Lord promised. And you, have you found that latter end and torment of which the Lord assured yon, or have you not found it?&quot; His honored companions having remarked to him, . &quot; they are dead and how can they hear and how can they speak ?&quot;, the glory of the world replied, &quot; By the truth of God who has commissioned me to be a true prophet, they are better able to hear than yourselves: there is only this difference, that they are not able to answer.&quot; And the prophet of God declared that the spirits of martyrs arc in lanterns under ttio empyrean: and according to another account that they arc suspended to the fruits of the trees of Faradisc in the craws of green birds. In brief, whoever will study carefully the verses of the Koran, the Traditions and recollections that have reached us respecting death, and will consider the well substantiated accounts of the movements of the dead in grave yards, he will know, in a manner that should remove all doubt, that the dead clearly do not become non-existent. ...</span></p>

Yet if, while in that state, fear and terror should happen to predominate and deprive him of feeling and motion, and if he become so far like the dead that he perceives no external object, the same<span class='gtxt_body'>
things may be revealed to him which are revealed to others after death. It is sometimes permitted, after he returns from that state to the sensible world, that all he has seen should remain in his memory, or that if he does not remember it, traces of it should remain in his mind. If he saw hell, he will retain traces of despondency, sadness, heaviness of spirit, suspicion and melancholy. If in the treasury of his imagination he has preserved these traces, it is lawful for him to communicate them to others. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The torments of the grave, O seeker after the divine mysteries, aro of two kinds: ono kind is spiritual and the other is material tortnont, and they havo been repeatedly explained.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The spiritual torment cannot be understood, until a person is acquainted with his own soul and spirit. His soul exists in its own individuality: it is not dependent upon form or mould: it has neither hand or foot, nor eye or ear. The external senses which it possessed were dependent on the body, and remain inactive and useless after death, and all the enjoyments resulting from them become entirely null. Wife, children, friends, property, slaves and domesties, equipage, cattle, estates and fields were formerly sources of enjoyment to it. And if he were a lover of, and a seeker after these things, so that he had been always occupied with them, the torment of separation from them will make a deep impression upon his soul, and ho will be most certainly the subject of sorrow and lamentation. But if his heart was untrammeled by these delights, and was inclined towards the future world and was always awaiting death, if the enjoyments of tho world were distasteful to him, while ho was always occupied with tho wants of tho soul, which are to find out God &#8212; then, in tho event of death, he will havo attained his longing and his love, and huvo reached rest, joy and <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness. </span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Call to mind now, that the spirit of a man is eternal: it has not perished at death. Can you doubt then, that that spirit which had chosen the glare and glitter of the world for its beloved object, and had been absorbed heart and soul in the occupations of the world &#8212; when in a moment of time, all that which it had been gaining day after day, which it had obtained with great perseverance and industry, and which it had been coveting and striving for during many years, is taken out of its hands by death, can you doubt that it will be the prey of endless sorrow and grief, of abundant mortification, regret and remorse? This accords with what the apostlo of Clod declares,&quot; Love, what thou hast loved: but thou shall be separated from it.&quot; But when a man realizes that this world is a stage of a journey, and that the purpose of his coming hither is to attain the knowledge and love of God, and when he is day and night occupied with this, forsaking the world before death arrives, and perhaps eveu envying and longing for death, there can be no doubt that in the event of death, he is delivered from all pain and sorrow, aud obtains rest and spiritual union.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>From what has been said, it follows that the torments of the grave are for the friends of this world and the seekers of the world, and not for the devout and pious. And here we find an explanation of what the prophet of God said: that&quot; the world is the prison of the believer and the paradise of the infidel.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Since you have now learned, O student, that the torment of the grave is occasioned by love of the world, know also that thero are different degrees of it. It is in proportion to each person&#39;s affection and love for tho world, and will come upon somo with grout severity. . . .</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If, for example, a person possess a female slave to whom he is exceedingly attached, and on account of his being every day by her side, he is not conscious of his attach</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>niont, and then if suddenly ho should become offended with her and sell her to another person, and should afterwards become conscious of his concealed love, his heart would hourly assail him and sting him like a serpent. The fire of regret and rage would burn within him, so that he might be not only sick from its effects, but might even die. Now if it is possible that such results should follow from the loss of a female slave, consider what must be the degree of grief and affliction of a man who is suddenly called upon to part with all his beloved objects in a moment. Just as it might happen that the master of the female slave should throw himself into the water to drown himself, or cast himself into the fire to burn himself, all on account of his separation from her, so those spirits of men who are in their graves utter many wishes, exclaiming,&quot; Ah! would that these scorpions and serpents, like those in the material world, would only sting us and destroy us, that at least we might be delivered from this torment.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Pain in the world is an accident of the body, and passes from the body to the spirit, and thus the spirit participates in the torment. But in the future world, pain has its home in the spirit itself, and hence it is excruciating.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Every ono bears away from this world within himself the essence of his torment, but men aro not aware of it. God says in his eternal word, &quot;Ah! if you knew by infallible knowledge, you would see hell, you would see it with the eyes of certainty,&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">&#39;</span> and again He says in another place in the glorious Koran, &quot; Truly hell oucompasseth the infidels.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span> He does not say, <i>it shall encompass, </i>but rather that it already surrounds them. . . .</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>since every one has cither children, a house, horses or servants, and that it results, without doubt, in causing a feeling of dependence upon them: and hence, no person will be able to escape the torments of the grave,&#39;&#39; we observe, in reply, that what you say is correct, but then there are persons who have no relations of dependence upon the world, and who always desire death from the Lord God. The prophets themselves did not pass away from the world until they longed for death. You should know also, that the rich who are attached to this world are of two classes. One class includes those, who although they have a love for the world, yet they love the blessed God more. Au illustration of the character of mcu of this class, may be . found in the man who owns a house in each of two cities; while living in one of them he has no longing to remove to the other. But it happens that an office is conferred upon him in that other city, and immediately he is over-_ joyed, and is eager to go there, and makes every preparation to remove thither and to forsake his first house. His longing for an office, leads him to move, and takes away all desiro of remaining where he was previously. Xow although men of this class have an inclination to the world, yet as on the other side the love of God preponderates, they prefer to go to the future world, and would not indeed, if it were possible to do otherwise, remain here a day. When persons of this class die, whoso affections preponderate towards tho other world, they do not experience the torments of the grave.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The other class, beloved, includes those who are entirely absorbed in the love of the world, and of pleasure. This class cannot escape from the torments of the grave, as the Lord in his everlasting word declares: &quot;There are none of yon who will not bo precipitated.&quot;&#39; But some of this class occasionally have a leaning towards eternal truth, especially</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>if there is any trace of the love of God remaining in their hearts, ami when they are about to leave the world, they forget it and never more yearn towards it. In that case they also are saved from the tribulations of the grave. A picture of this class is found in the person who also has a house in ef.ch of two cities, and as long as ho is living in the one, ho has no longings for the other. But at last some necessity compels him to quit his first house, and to go and reside in the second. After a few days residence, the love he had for the first house dies away from his heart and it appears better to him not to return thither. This class suffer torment in the grave up to the point where they forget the world, but after familiarizing themselves with the mansions of the future world, they arc freed from their pain. <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Tiiohc, </span>however, whose hearts wcro immersed in the pleasure* and dm<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span>* of the world, and whoso hearts horo no trace of the love of (lod, or of thonghtfulness for the fnturo world, and who preferred this world to the other, will never bo delivered from torment.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There is not a person in the world who will admit that he does not love God, or but that will pretend that ho does love God. But this pretention can be brought to a touchstone and standard and found out by experiment. Just look at his actions and conduct, and see whether ho will do a thing which has the holy approbation of God, or whether ho will abstain from doing a thing which has not the divine approbation, notwithstanding the strong opposing inclinations of his soul, and thus show his reverence for the Holy Law. If he does thus oppose the desires of his soul, ho is correct when he affirms, &quot;I love God.&quot; But if he is following the inclinations of his soul, and is only saying with his tongue that he loves God, his declaration is a lie. When a person in this state of mind utters the confession, &quot; There is no God but God,&quot; a voice from God addresses him saying, &quot;You are a liar, for your actions<span class='gtxt_body'>
are opposed to your words.&quot; In this state of mind there is no use in making the declaration, &quot; I love God.&quot; The prophet of God says however, that it is not an idle net to utter the phrase &quot;There is no God but God&quot; for the sake of preserving u man from the divine vengeance, so long as the man is one who does not prefer worldly works to the works of the future world. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Let those, then, who wish to be saved from the torments of the grave.be earnest in cutting off the ties of the world; and let them .acquire a habit of being satisfied with just that which is of actual necessity. Be satisfied for example with that amount of food and drink which is necessary to give strength for devotional exercises; be satisfied with tho amount of clothing necessary to protect the body from cold and boat; and so in everything else. If a man cannot purify his heart from attachment to the world lot him at least be assiduous in devotion and in calling upon God, and show a preference for cultivating an intimacy with the love of God. Let him look with fear and dread upon trust in the world, and weaken and relax the demauds of sense by strict obedience to the law. If notwithstanding he should prefer to yield to the animal soul and to trust in this world, let him prepare himself to experience the torment of the grave and the terrors of the future world. And may the grace and mercy of God which embrace all men, and his pardon and forgiveness which extend to rich and poor, to great and small, reach and save him!</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <i>material torments </i>of the grave, 0 seeker after the divine mysteries, arc those which are addressed to the body and through the body to the spirit. <i>Spiritual </i>torments are those which reach the spirit only. The language of God, &quot;It is the fire of God, the lighted fire which shall reach the hearts of the reprobates,&quot; refers to spiritual torments which affect the heart. The spiritual hell then is of three kinds. The first is the fire of separation from tho<span class='gtxt_body'>
lusts of the world; the second is thc fire of slmme, ignominy nnd reproach; and the third is the tire of exclusion from the beauty of the one Lord. These fires only burn the soul and do not touch the body.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There is in the world a cause or souree of each kind-of torment. Then let us examine the cause of the fire of separation from the lusts of the world. In explaining previously the torments of the grave, we said that they arose from love of the world. Love and desire constitute the Paradise of the heart. So long as the heart is with its beloved object, it is in paradise, and as soon as the heart is separated from its beloved object, it is in hell. The men of this world, by their supreme love of the world, have made it to be their beloved object, and as long as they are in the world it is a real paradise to them; but as soon as death comes and separates them from their beloved, their state is a real hell to them. Believers, by loving God and the future world, have made thcrn their best beloved, and as long as they are separated from them they are in hell. But as soon as this separation is annihilated, and they leave this world and go to the other, having attained their chief purpose and desire, they are in paradise in reality.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Suppose a person, a prince, had been passing his life in banqueting and pleasure, and every one around him had been submissive and obedient to his orders. But an enemy comes and deprives him of his principality, enslaves his wife and servants, and they plunder him of his money and property before his eyes. His pearls and jewels are wasted upon trilles, and his beautiful studs of horses and his retinue are dispersed, He becomes a subject in his own city, is compelled to wear coarse clothing in the presence of his former servants, and is appointed to guard and focd the dogs. Can you in any wise appreciate the misfortune into which the prince has fallen, and how deeply he must be a prey to anguish? Probably he exclaims many times in a</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>day, &quot; Would rather that I had fallen into the abyss of the earth and perished!&quot; The severity of his torture is in proportion to the amount of sensual enjoyments in which he had participated while he was a prince. And it is plain that this torture is not inflicted on the body, but upon only the spirit, and that it is more excruciating than any pains of the body would be.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>So long as a man is attached to the things of this world engrossed with the care of his body, and gives over his nature to intercourse with sensual enjoyments, he will not care for the warnings his spirit receives in this world, nor for the torment that it will incur in the future world. A sick man for example will not be so excessively despondent about his malady iu the day time, because his&#39;senses are interested in other things, and as his heart follows in their train, he in some measure forgets his malady. Iu the night, however, when his senses have nothing to be employed about, his thoughts about his malady do not leave his mind free for one moment, and his pain increases. So also in death, the cares and thoughts of the world and the external senses cease entirely to operate on account of the torment of the spirit, and then the perfect torment of the spirit becomes manifest.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The second kind of torment in hell, beloved, is the tire of ignominy and shame. In illustration of this, suppose that a prince receives into his friendship a poor and humbio man, treating him with great honor and making him tho favorite among all his confidential servants, lie gives into his hands the keys of all his treasuries, commits his honor and wife and family to his care, and in short confides all his affairs into his hands, in full reliance upon him. Then, suppose that the poor man, after being elevated to this high rank, should bo pulled up with pride, and should bo disposed to betray the honor of the prince,&#8212; that he should begin to indulge in unworthy conduct with his wife<span class='gtxt_body'>
and servants, and should open his coffers and spend his property for his own pleasures. Suppose farther that he should even be consulting with the prince&#39;s enemy who has designs upon the principality, and should enter into a compact with him. Just at this point the prince from a concealed retreat espies his conduct in his family, and learns how he has wasted his money and his possessions, and in short becomes acquainted with everything he has done. The man also learns that for some time the prince has been aware of his course of conduct, but that the reason of his delaying and postponing punishment was that he might see what other crimes he would commit, that he might punish him accordingly. In these cireumstances the reflecting can easily appreciate what would be the confusion and mortification of this individual. He would think it a thousand times better to fall from a precipice and be dashed to pieces, or that the earth should open and he sink into the abyss, than that he should continue to live. So also is it with you. How many actions you perform, of which you say, &quot; it is in private and no one sees it,&quot; or of which Satan cloaks over the guilt from your mind, by persuading you that it is all right and fair. But at last, when death comes and makes . your sin manifest, then the fire of ignominy and shame makes you captive to tieree torments and long continued misery. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Another illustration of the fire of shame and ignominy is, to suppose that a prince is giving his son in marriage, and that after many days spent in feasting and rejoicing on the occasion the moment has come for the son to receive his bride. The son, however, has secretly withdrawn with some of his friends and become so intoxicated as to be incapable of reasoning. But at last he concludes that it is time for him to return, and that he will go secretly and alone. He sets out, therefore, on his return home, out of his mind and unconscious of what he is about. lie walks on until he reaches a door through which he sees lights burning. He fancies that it is his own house, and straightway he enters in. He looks around and observes that there is not the least movement, not even a breath, but that all have gone to sleep. At last in the middle of the court he sees some one covered over with damask silks and brocades, from whose body is exhaled the odor of musk. He fancies and exclaims that this must be his lawful bride, and he kneels down before her and kisses her lips. Ho observes that his mouth is damp with moisture that exudes from her lips, and that he is touching something wet. The mouth of his beloved is wounded and bloody, and he thinks that it is rose water, and continues to caress her, till he isstupified with sleep. After a while he awakes and comes into his right mind, and pereeives that he is in a sepulchral chapel of the fire-worshippers, and that what he had embraced was nothing but the body of on old woman ninety years old, who had died six mouths<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>When the prince&#39;s son sees himself in this condition, sliame and mortification overwhelm him to such a degree, that he is upon the point of destroying himself. But still severer anguish lays hold of him, lest, when he should leave the place in this filthy state, he should he seen by some person. While he is asking himself what he should do, his father who knew nothing as to the place where his son had been, but who had left his palace with his friends and his suite in search of his son, meets him just at the moment he is coming out of that house in that state. Imagine now the shame of the son and what must be his feelings. No doubt but that he would have given his life to any one who could have offered him a refuge and deliverance from his shame. You see that the torment here is spiritual and not material; for there is not an iota of.pain here that affected the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In like manner the men of this world when they go to their graves, will see that what they called pleasure was flesh and corruption which they had unlawfully taken into their mouths. They will see that that beloved object, dressed in rich clothing, obtained by illicit means and stained with pollution, is but the old hug the world, with her disgusting face and horrid smell ami putrefied corruption, on account of whom so many drowned in illusions have become victims to shame and remorse. Still more bitter torment will that be, beloved, which will bo the lot of man, when in the day of resurrection and assembly all these crimes and sins shall be laid open before all the angels and prophets. Our refuge is in God!</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Think not that the shame and remorse of the future world is only of the kind that we have been describing.<span class='gtxt_body'>
For we have before said that nothing belonging to the future world can be understood in the present world, or <i>hi </i>rightly conceived of by our minds. The doctors of the law however (upon whom may God show merey!), for the Bake of warning and admonition in the world, and so far as the mind can appreciate it, have spoken in parables and illustrations, and they have in various ways compared the ignominy and remorse of the future world to the shame and misery existing in the present world, notwithstanding the misery in this world is but for a moment or a <i>i&#39;cw </i>days, while the other is everlasting.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>We come now, beloved, to the third fire, the fire of separation from the divine beauty, and of despair of attaining everlasting felicity. The cause of this fire, is that conduct and stupidity which led the individual, while in the world, not to acquire a knowledge of God, to neglect purifying the mirror of his heart from the consuming cares ot the world and from the rust of sensual pleasures, and to omit those austerities and exertions by which his blamable inclinations and dispositions might be changed to laudable ones. The individual did not act in accordance with the tradition which says, &quot; Acquire a character resembling the character of God,&quot; and by means of which he might have been worthy of the vision of the beauty of the Lord, and of being received at the king&#39;s court. The heart which is full of the love of the world, and of the rust of worldly cares and transgressions, will sec nothing in the future world, must be shut out from all kinds of felicity and will rise blind at the resurrection. Our refuge is in God!</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>An illustration of this fire of reprobation and banishment may be found in this world, by supposing that a company travelling by night should come into a valley that was very stony, and as they went on their way, they should hear a voice calling out, &quot;Take good heed and curry away with you an abundance of these stones; you</p>

Others still, did not carry away any, saying, &quot; it is folly to take pains and trouble for the sake of an advantage that is future and prospective: indeed it is not clear that there will be any advantage at all.&quot; Besides, they treated as stupid and foolish those who did carry any away, and said,&quot; look at those insane people, who, from pure cupidity and craving for what is impossible, load themselves down like asses, and give themselves useless pains. We are tho comfortable ones, who go on our way free, joyful and without concern for the future.&quot; When the light of day dawned, they saw that all the stones were invaluable rubies and sapphires, each one of which was worth at least three thousand drachms of silver. Then those who had brought away stones, exuhumed, &quot;alas! that we were not able to bring away any more.&quot; But those who had brought away nothing and had traveled with comfort and case, were overwhelmed with the fire of reprobation; they strike theirheada upon the ground with the energy of remorse, and are filled with sighs and lamentations. Those who had brought away stones, arrived at the city whither they had been going, and bought estates and slaves, jewels and rich and pleasant eatables and all kinds of raiment, and gave themselves up to banqueting and enjoyment, while those who had not brought away any stones, became so hungry, destitute and naked, that they went about desiring to perform for them some kind of service. But when they begged of them cither food or drink, they said, in accordance with what God says in his ancient word. &quot;The dwellers in tire shall call out to the inhabitants of Paradise,&#39; pour out upon us a little of your water and of the enjoyments God has bestowed upon you.&#39;&quot; They will answer,&quot; God has forbidden<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>This illustration of the* enjoyments of Paradise has been made in very brief and comprehensive language, to serve as an example, but it is impossible by any similitude to give an idea of what it is to bo separated from the contemplation of the beauty of the Lord. For whoever has but once experienced the delight of being near to God, and has enjoyed the vision of the beauty of the Lord, would perish if he should be for one moment separated from it. Even the last and least person who quits hell will receive u mansion from the Lord God which is equal to ten of these worlds. But we do not mean to say ten worlds in surface or lu amount by number and weight, but ten worlds in value and in the beauty they display and the pleasure they afford.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Having now become acquainted with the three kinds of spiritual torment, know, O student of the divine mysteries, that these spiritual fires of which we have been speaking, are more severe than the fires which burn the body. The body does not itself pereeive pain, and until pain reaches from the body to the spirit, it does not make a trace or impression. If, then, the anguish that is occasioned to the spirit through the channel of the body is so agonizing, imagine how intense must burn the fire of that anguish which has its origin in the centre of the soul. The pain which any thing suffers is occasioned by the excess of something coutrary to the nature aud necessities of its constitution.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The necessities of the constitution of the spirit are to know God and to contemplate his beauty and excellence. But if stupidity and blindness, which are opposed to this tendency of the spirit, become predominant, the soul will be vexed and tormented, and there will be no end to the torment. If it were not that the body is subject to maladies in the world, the fact of this blindness and stupidity would have beon visible and apparent to the soul in this world also, and it would also have been the souree of immense anguish, and torment would at no moment have ceased to afflict men. Just as when a person has a severe sore upon the hand or foot, if besides it should be cut with a knife or fire should be put upon it, he would not feel the pain of the knife or the fire, on account of the pain of the sore, so likewise the maladies of the body, such as hunger and thirst, or such maladies as love of possessions and family, combined with the absorbed attention of the senses to these things, prevent the soul from being conscious of its disquiet and distress. But when in death, the torment to which the body was subject is taken away, it will be seen how excruciating is the torment of the soul. And thus also God announces in his holy word: &quot;Ah! if you knew it with infallible assurance. But you will see hell: yon will see it with the eyes of certainty.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">&#39;</span></p>

But this is not to be wondered at, when wo consider that tho mass of the pcoplo regard themselves as fixed in their character and position, and not as pilgrims and travellers to a higher state. There isno possibility of unveiling the things of truth, to those who settle down without desiring to make any progress, p,ml who aro contented with tho first stages and degrees of tho sensible world and of the world of fancy. They can neither attain to a spiritual state, nor understand spiritual laws and precepts.

But if we had entered into any farther developments, they would not have been able to understand us, for none but those who are endowed with penetration and experience can by any possibility understand the topies to which we have alluded.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There is a class of foolish people, O inquirer after the divine mysteries, who have neither capacity for knowledge, or sound judgment to be able to understand anything of themselves, and who have remained doubting and speculating about the nature of the future state, till they have become bewildered. Finally, as the lusts of the world harmonized with their natures, they have yielded to tho whisperings of Satan, and deny that there is any future state. They pretend that the only need there is of speaking of heaven and hell, is for the sake of correcting and guiding the conduct of the people, and they regard as folly the course of those who follow the law and arc constant in their devotions.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If these foolish persons hnvo one jot of sense, it will bo easy to convince thom with u single word. One hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets more or less, the wholo multitude of the saints and all the learned doctors of the law have faithfully followed the Holy Law, have been diligent in their devotions, and with prudent anxiety and dread about the future state, they have endured much pain and suffering. And how does it happen that you, who are so ignorant and stupid, have found out that they were mistaken and in error? What should lead you to prefer your baseless and corrupt fancies to their knowledge and science, and to say that the spirit has no real existence and that it does not continue to live after death? Perhaps you do not even admit that there is any <i>material </i>punishment. Truly the health of your moral being is so corrupted and depraved, that there is no cure for you; you belong to that class of whom God says in his holy word: &quot;Even when thou shalt call them into the right path, they will never follow in it.&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">&#39;</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If one of these men should, however, reply: &quot;Indeed I do not know for a certainty, but why should I on account of an uncertainty, pass my precious lite in devotional austerities, and forbid myself the delights and pleasures of the world?&quot; We observe in return. According to your principles, the probabilities are balanced as to whether the events spoken of as belonging to the future world will or will not happen. It follows then as a most rational conclusion, that you ought to act in the same way you would do, if you wished to preserve yourself from a great risk and danger. For, if these events should take place, you may thereby be saved from intense torment and obtain eternal felicity; whereas, if they should not occur, you will have suffered no injury from your precautions.

You would say to yourself: &quot;If I do not eat it, I have nothing to sutler but to remain hungry for a while longer, but if I eat it, I may kill myself. It is prudent, therefore, for me to refrain from it.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Again, if you were sick, and a person who writes magical phrases and charms, should say to you, &quot;give me a drachm of silver, and I will write for you a well tried charm by means of which you will immediately get well,&quot; although you know that there is no relation of fitness between an external charm, and an internal disorder of the stomach for instance, and that there is little probability of your recovering by its means, you are still disposed to take it. And you say, &quot;Come, let me have it, if it act as a medicine, I shall be a gainer by so many drachms of silver, and if it do me no good, I shall only have lost a single drachm. I ought therefore to try it.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Once more, if an astrologer should say to you, &quot; if you will drink this bitter and disagreeable medicine, you will not be attacked with illness during the whole of this coming year, for the moon is in such a station among the heavenly bodies,&quot; notwithstanding the lie of the astrologer should be very clear to your mind, and you have no confidence in what he says, you would reply, &quot;well, let me<span class='gtxt_body'>

But the learned in religion, for the Rake of saving you from the malady of stupidity, and rebellion and bringing yon to everlasting health and felicity, have exerted themselves to make the verses of the Koran and tho holy traditions to serve as a medicine to deliver you from bitter torment. Still you attach no credit to their words. You treat the Koran and tho traditions with entire disregard, neither clinging to the commandments of God, nor avoiding forbidden things. You follow the bent of your own inclinations, instead of following the example and law of the prophet of God, aml you indulge in many acts of transgression. Nor do you call to mind what will be your condition in the end of it all, nor how long a time you have yet to live in the world, nor what eternity is compared with this world. Do you not know that by choosing a very little pain in the business of religion during this short lite and in this worthless world, you may gain eternal felicity, and riches that cannot be taken from you? The pain which we may suft&#39;er in this world, however severe, yet does not weigh the amount of an atom in comparison with the pains and torment of the other world. This world is a fading shadow, but the future world 18 abiding and eternal.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Beware, therefore, beloved of exposing yourself to eternal torments; call to mind the great risk and danger you are to encounter in the future world: address to your soul serious admonitions, before you come to be ashamed and fall into captivity and chastisement: ask your soul, saying, &#39;&#8226; O rebellious soul, how much misery thou dost undergo for the sake of gaining the world! What long and distant journeys thou dost undertake, how often dost thou remain* hungry and thirsty, notwithstanding thon are both transitory thyself and all thou dost gain is transitory; and yet all this time God himself has engaged to supply all your needs. But on the other hand what hast thou done to secure eternal salvation in the mansions of the future world, to be delivered from misery and reach unchanging felicity? If thou art not able to endure the least pain or toil for religion in this world, how wilt thou be able to bear in the future world both material and spiritual torments, together with the torments of the imagination?&quot;</p>

Now, is it not strange folly and sottishness to be proud of the transitory pleasures of the world in a life which lasts but for one or two days, and to turn our backs upon future eternal joys?

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O traveller on the way and seeker after the love of God! know that the love of God isa sure and perfect method for the believer to attain the object of his desires. It is a highly exalted station of rest, during the journey of the celestial traveller. It is the consummation of the desires and longings of thoso who seek divine truth. It is tho foundation of the vision of the beauty of tho Lord.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The love of God is of the most binding obligation upon every one. It is indeed the spirit of the body, and the light of the eye. The prophet of God declares that the faith of the believer is not complete, unless he love God and his prophet more than all the world besides. The prophet was<span class='gtxt_body'>
once asked, what is faith? He replied,&quot; It is to love God and his prophet more than wife, children and property.&quot; And the prophet was continually in the habit of praying, &quot;O my God! I ask for thy love, I ask that I may love whomsoever loves thee, and that I may perform whatsoever thy lovo makes incumbent upon mo.&quot;</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On the resurrection day all sects will be addressed by thename of the prophet whom each followed, &quot;O people of Moses! O people of Jesus! O people of Mohammed!&quot; even to all the beloved servants of God, and it will be proclaimed to them, &quot;O Friends and beloved ofGod.comc to the blessed union and society of God! Come to Paradise and partake of the grace of your beloved <i>I&quot; </i>When they hear this proclamation, their hearts will leap out of their places, and they will almost lose their reason. Yahya ben Moa&#39;z says, &quot;It is better to have as much love of God, even if only as much as a grain of mustard seed, than seventy years of devotion and obedience without love.&quot; Hassan of Basra says, &quot;Whoever knows God, will certainly love him, and whoever knows the world, will shun it.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>0 thou who seekest the love of God! know that this love is founded upon two things: one is Beauty, and the other is Beneficence. Beauty acts as a cause to produce love, because the being, the attributes and the works of God possess beauty, and every one loves that which is beautiful. There is a tradition which says &quot; Verily, God is beautiful and he loves beauty.&quot; And the prophet says, &quot;Desire to transact your affairs with those who have beautiful countenances.&quot; It is on this account that the spirit in man has been created in accordance with the imago of beauty, so that whenever it either hears or sees anything beautiful, it may have a propensity towards it, and seek for communion with it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>But you should also know, that beauty is of two kinds, one of which is beauty of form, and the other beauty of<span class='gtxt_body'>
moral character. And know, 0 beloved, that the renson why man must love beauty of form in his own speciea, and has an inclination to admire external beauty, is that God created the spirits of men out of a drop of his own light, as he says. &quot; when I have breathed my spirit into him.&quot; 1 And as the spirit has thus been created out of the light of the Lord God, it is so essentially beautiful, that if man were capable of seeing the degree of its beauty, he would become bereft of reason and perhaps would perish from the effects of the impression.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This also should be known, that beauty of form belongs to the spirit, and not <i>to </i>the body. It is a proof that there is nothing agreeable in the body by itself, that when the spirit is separated from the body by death, no one has any inclination afterwards to look upon the face of the dead, but on the contrary his feelings repel him and he turns away from it. And however near a friend or relative the person may be, wo have no disposition to approach his sido again. The body of man is created of opaque earth, and the spirit by entering into the body is entirely veiled, so that it can neither bo seen or known.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is clear then that the beauty of form possessed by man and the beauty of many other things arise from their being created from the light of the Lord. Consider then, as far as human reason can reach, if such beauty aud elegance exist in spirits formed out of one drop of the light of the blessed God, what must be the beauty and splendor of the Lord God himself. Since then the beauty of every beloved object is derived from his light, and that the beauty of every thing that is beautiful is from him, it follows that he who is wise, ought not to permit himself to bo deceived by the soul which passes away, and to be attracted to that beauty which is fleeting, but that he should</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O! seeker of divine love, that which renders man favorably inclined to persons of virtuous character, is the fact that God has created man after his own character; as it has como to us in the tradition that, &quot;verily God created man after his own image.&quot; Hence whenever man sees or hears of a quality belonging to his own race and kind, as justice, generosity, forgiveness or patience, he will certainly havo a sympathy with that quality and excreiso love to its poiwiwor. If wo hear for instance that in a certain country there is a just sovereign or a just vizier, we heartily love that king or vizier, and we are always praising his excellence and worth, although there is not the least probability of any advantage accruing to us from his justice. Such a sovereign was Nushirvan, who notwithstanding he was an infidel yet as he was just, the heart of every man is drawn towards him. If again we hear of the knowledge, science, clemency or munificence of any persons, as of the Imam Abu Hanite, of the Imam Shafei, of Bayezid of Bistan, or of Juneid of Bagdad, the spirit of a man will be attracted towards them on account of those qualities, be will love them, and he will certainly desire to see them and to be with them. If we hear of a generous man, although he<span class='gtxt_body'>
may be in a foreign country, and we have no hope of any advantage from him or of any token of his generosity to ourselves, yet still from necessity we will love him, and whenever his name is mentioned we will invoke blessings upon him and praise him. It is thus with Hatem Tai whose name, though he was an infidel, is upon every tongue, because he was a generous and benevolent man, and all hearts are irresistibly led to love him. . . .</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In this view of the subject, O seeker of the truth, and friend who longs for the bright vision, when you consider what an impulse we have to admire and to love man who is encompassed with so many defects, and whose qualities are subject to decay, &#8212; be candid and reflect, that all the attributes of God are perfect, that all his titles are glorious, and that all his works are made in infinite wisdom, and how then can there be a man of such animal affections and propensities us not to love him with all his heart and soul!

<p class='gtxt_body'>You should know also that in the world of spirits, God hnd ennobled man with beauty and its qualities, and had made him sufficiently acquainted with Himself and His attributes; and the spirits continued for a long time participating in enjoyment in the land of affection, intoxicated and in eestacy with the cup of love and the wine of celestial union. Afterwards in accordance with divine wisdom and by soverign decree, they fell from that exalted world to this lower world,&#8212; from the world of union to the world of separation. In this world of trial, having entered into bodies ami become entangled with (ho things of <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Moiiso </span>and wiili worldly occupations, and shut out from the spiritual world, the) forgot its intimate friendships and the joys of its society. Being so far distant from that world, the being and character of God became completely veiled from the view of some, and the love and union which had existed in their hearts from all eternity disappeared. None the less however, it is still the case, that when man sees beauty and perfection, the spirit cannot help admiring it. But as the intimacy and friendship which had formerly existed have been clouded over, and the animal impulses, passions and lusts have become predominant, they imagine that the love of pleasure belongs to the delights of religion, and regard it as a necessity of the soul.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The spirits of 3cme men, however, in becoming attached to a body, retained the divine guidance, and the spiritual world in consequence was not concealed from their view, nor did they forget its friendly society or the attributes and qualities of its holy spirits. And as the glory of the infinite being and his attributes was not veiled from their eyes, their desire for the blessed union and longing for the vision of beauty increased daily. In accordance with this, it is related by Soheil Testeri (may God&#39;s mercy bo upon him !) that &quot; from the moment that the blessed God in the world of spirits and the assembly of holy anion<span class='gtxt_body'>
asked the spirits &quot;Am I not your Lord ?&quot;i and they called out in an answer &quot;yes!&quot; that loving answer has never waned or decayed within my soul.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O thou who longest after the love of God! the second cause of love in man which we have mentioned, viz: beneficence, operates through the state of poverty and need in which man has been created. Both in the affairs of the world and in the concerns of religion, man is in want of an infinite variety of things, as God says in his word, &quot;Verily, God is rich, but ye are poor.&quot;.* Hence a man always loves and honors whatever person enables him to obtain any object of which ho stands in need, or who makes it probable that ho will obtain it. This will be the case especially, if the same individual has at various times supplied his necessities. Ho will then be enslaved to him, heart and soul, and whenever his name is mentioned will chant his praise and invoke blessings upon him. The proverb snys, &quot; man is a slave to beneficence.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In matters of religion, man has need of helpers of two kinds. The first class are the great expounders of doctrine,<span class="gstxt_sup">5</span> who instruct him in religious precepts, and preserve him from the darkness of ignorance and the dangers of doubt. They also make him acquainted with the restrictions of the law, and the regulations and ceremonies of worship. They explain to him what conduct corresponds with rectitude, and what is improper,&#8212; what is lawful and what unlawful. The second class of helpers to man are the venerable preachers.<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> It is their province to throw<span class='gtxt_body'>
light upon the nature of the way of life, and upon the true condition in which man is placed. They point out the means and methods hy which tho slave of desire may secure n change of his vicious inclinations, and hy which the disordered soul may obtain a pure and virtuous character. They set forth tho transitory nature of the world and the shame and sin of being attached to it. They endeavor to persuade men that the design of their entrance into the world is that they may love and know God; and they strive to turn them away from following the world, by giving them ideas of the joys and rest of the other world, and of the delight and preciousuess of the vision of the beauty of tho Lord, that so they may live as pilgrims to eternity. The whole reason why the apprentice loves his master, and every disciple loves his teacher, and why tho wise and excellent love the experienced Sheikh whose lessons they hear, or love the doctors of the law and the saints of olden time is that they have been <i>beneficent, </i>and have supplied their wants.</span></p>

Ought you not to praise him with your tongue, and love him with your heart?

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O inquirer after the love of God! The love of God exists in every heart, though it lies concealed, just as fire exists in the flint stone, until it is drawn out. If you take the steel of desire and affection into your hands, and with it strike the heart, you obtain fire by the means, and your <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Soui </span>will be filled with light. The malice, deceit fulness, hatred, vileness, envy and strife that are in tho heart will bo burned np, and it will be freed and purified from sensual perturbations. But if you are careless and do nothing and pass several days without seeking, the heart will again become like lire covered over with ashes, which by remaining n long lime, unused, will finally bo extinguished. So at last the heart, becomes encased with sensual impurities and with the blackness of the passions, and is no longer capable of being enlightened with the light of truth. Our refuge is in God!</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>O, faithful friend, who art worthy to be loved! know, that the love of God is a standard that leads to victory. Whoever seeks refuge under it, will be a sovereign in two worlds, and lord of a throne at the king&#39;s court. This love is a universal solvent to secure <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness. </span>Whoever secures it, is richer than in the possession of both worlds. God is always rich, notwithstanding all the world is provided for through him. The heart which bears no traces of tho love of God, is like a dead corpse, which knows nothing of its own spirit. Still thero is no person among reasonable beings who will say that he does not love God, or who will not make pretensions to possessing <i>a </i>love for him. .15ut it is like an empty claim, upon which no decision can be based and, unless the witness is a faithful one,</p>
</div>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>no conclusion can be formed. If you should be asked, do you love God, beware and give no answer. For if you say I do not love him, (our refuge is in God), you would make yourself an infidel. And if you say in answer, &quot; I love him,&quot; yet you have no signs or tokens of your loving Him.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Now know that there are <i>seven signs of love to God. </i>In whomsoever these marks are found, his pretensions to loving God are to bo regarded as well founded.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tho first sign of love to God is, not to bo al&#39;rnid of death, mid to bo always wailing for it. For death unites Iho friend to his friend,&#8212; the seeker to the object which ho seeks. As long as attachment to and dependence upon the world cannot be broken off, the traces of love to God cannot be visible. If a person, however, is afraid of death and does not feel a readiness to go into the presence of God, and yet is making every provision for his journey into the other world, it does not follow that he does not possess the love of God. It is, on the contrary, an evidence that he does love God.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is a second sign of love to God, when a man prefers the love of God to any worldly object, chooses whatsoever draws him near to God, and forsakes whatsoever has <i>a </i>tendency to turn him away from God. Ho desires always to act in accordance with his will and with his approbation. But it is not an indication that a person is entirely destitute of love to God, because he is not in every circumstance submissive to the holy will of God. For, in some persons love may exist in perfection, while in others it may be in some measure defective. It is said, for example, that during the life of the apostle of God, one of his companions was a wine drinker, and he had oftentimes been punished for it. Another of his companions one day vexed at his conduct, cursed bim. The prophet happened to hear him curse him, and knocked for him to come in. When he hud come into his presence ho said, &quot;Why do you curse<span class='gtxt_body'>
that man? He is both a friend of God and of his prophet, and loves them.&quot;</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The third sign of a man&#39;s love to God is that the remembrance of God is always fresh in his heart. He never ceases to meditate upon God. Every man thinks upon and calls to mind an object in proportion to his love to it. If a person&#39;s love and affection is perfect he never forgets that object. If a person say, I lovo both God and a certain worldly object, attention should be paid tosee which of them he loved the HHWt. And then that object can bo said to rule in his heart which he loves the most. Gradually from day to day, the object which preponderates will efface little by little all affection for the other.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fourth sign of love to God is, to love and respect the powerful Koran, regarding it as the word of God. A man ought to praise and love the prophets and saints, as the friends of God. He should love all men, saying that they were all created by tbo will and power of God. Whatever person attains to this point, his feelings of envy and hatred and even .his coldness of looks will be quelled and disappear, and he will treat all individuals as his friends.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fifth sign of love to God is that a man will choose the closet and retirement and have an eagerness for secret prayer. He will long and wait for the night, that the avocations and hindrances of the world may be banished, that he may be embarrassed by no distractions in his supplications to his incomparable and unique Friend, and that he may be alone in familiar intercourse with God.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is reported that in the days of the children of Israel, there was a slave who prayed every night from evening until morning, but he went out and performed his morning prayer under a tree. God spoke by inspiration to the one who was the prophet at that time and said, &quot; Go ami speak to that slave my servant thus:&#8212;You abandon<span class='gtxt_body'>
prayer to mo in secret and come out here to pray under thin tree, for the sako of the pleasure you derive from the music of the birds over your head. But in so doing you mutilate as it were my love and you will not again obtain it perfectly.&quot; It is also reported that God once said to David, &quot;O! David, that man is a liar, who pretends to love me and yet goes to bed and sleeps the whole time till morning. For does not a friend desire to see the countenance of his friend, and is he not eager to have intercourse with him? Whoever wishes to see me, will seek me and will find me.&quot;</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The sixth sign of love to God, is when a man finds the worship of God to be easy, inviting and delightful. It is related that ft certnin preacher<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> used to say, &#9632;&#39; I have served God in worship sixty years with irksomoness and constraint. I afterwards served him yet sixty years more, and my devotions were to me spiritual food; and in the absence or disuse of them, I did uot enjoy a moment&#39;s peace or quiet of mind.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The seventh sign of love to God is, that a man loves tho sincere friends and obedient servants of God, and regards them all as his friends. He regards all the enemies of God as his enemies and abhors them. And God thus speaks in his eternal word. &quot;His companions are terrible towards the infidels, and tender towards each other.&quot;&#39; A Sheikh was once asked &quot;who are the friends of tho oxalted and blessed God)&quot; Ho replied: &quot;Tho friends of God uro those who are more compassionate to the friends of God themselves, thau a father or a mother to their children.&quot;</p>

A clear view of what this table is, may bo obtained frum the following extract from a treatise of Bcrkevi explaining the Mussulman dogmas, which is at the prcscut day a text-book in the Turkish schools.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;It must lie confessed, that good and evil and every thing in short happens from the predestination and foreknowledge of God,&#8212; that all which has been and will be, was decreed from eternity and is written upon the preserved table, &#8212; that nothing can happen contrary to it,&#8212;that the faith of the believer, the piety of the pious man and his good works nro foreseen, willed, predestined and decreed in writing on the preserved tahlo, are produced, accepted and loved by God ;&#8212;but that the infidelity of infidols, the irrcligion of the wicked and the&#39;r bucPactions happen indeed with the foreknowledge of God, by his will, and as an effect of his predestination inscribed upon the preserved table, and by the operation of God, &#8212; but not with his satisfaction or affection.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Myhth&#39;m. </span>Wherever this word is found in this treatise, it is to bo understood that the original word i* soo/ir, and sometimes the word has been allowed to stiiud untranslated, Sooleo docs not necessarily mean any one paitieular society of Mussulmans, but includes all persons as well ns orders and congregations, who embrace mystical or transcendental modes of interpreting the Koran and who eon lor in their life in a greater or less degree to their mystical notions. Sool&#39;ee, Dervish and Fakir, are different words for various classes of oriental monks and mystics. They arc found wherever there are Mussulmans, and the differences between them and other Mussulmans bear a considerable relation to the differences developed, by mystics, pietists or puritans in Christian churches. They differ also much among themselves iu their modes of spiritualizatiou aud in their ceremonies and practices. There is also much jealousy of each other, between the dominant orthodox clergy and doctors of religion, and the mystics, dervishes aud preachers. The orthodox clergy<span class='gtxt_body'>
admit only the grammatical and literal &#8212; the external meaning of the Koran ; tut many Soofccs pretend that the outward meaning is but the shell, and that they seek for and expound the inward or mystical meaning. The reverence and esteem for the Soofees and Monks is so great with the people, that the clergy and doctors usually conceal their opposition and jealousy.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Soofceism has existed in one shape or other in every age and region; its mystical doctrines are to be found in the schools of ancient Greece and in those of the modern philosophers of Europe. It is the dream of the most ignorant and the most learned: it is to be found in the palace and the cottage, in the luxurious city, and the pathless desert.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fundamental doctrine, and the great object of longing of the oriental mystic is union with God. The whirling Dervishes as they are popularly called, imituto the founder of their particular order and whirl arouud on their toes lor an hour to the sound of soft music and muttered chants: and they imagine that the dizziness which is created and the prostration which follows is an inspired ccstacy and an approximation to the desired union. Mussulman mystics are extensively accused as are also a class of perfectionists in the Christian church, of regarding external actions as morally indifferent to those who arc spiritually enlightened. Their doctrines have been abused among themselves by fanatics to lead them to the commission of crime, as in the case of the attempt to assassinate the shah of Persia by the liabis. We should no more be led to think that there was any tendency to abuse for evil purposes from reading this treatise of Ghazzali, than to infer the same from devotional and mystic writings of the western world. Ghazzali, is as much disposed to censure hypocritical pretence among Soofees, as some writers on Persia have been to class nearly the whole body as hypocrites.</p>

Certain mouths and days of the month are peculiarly appropriate to works of charity.

<p class='gtxt_body'>from the point of view of the theological theory of the author, which is nothing less than that the moon was created on purpose to render possible, and to aid in carrying into effect, the ordinances of the uncreated Koran.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Note </span>D, p. 14. <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Interpretation </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Of </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>The </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Koran. </span>The extract below from the work of Ghazzali, the <i>Teha/eti Fdatlfl </i>or <i>Destruction of Philosophy, </i>while it shows the position he assigns to the doctors of the law, exemplifies also the character of his genins, and the measure of independent thought tolerated among Mussulmans. He fearlessly adopted whatever discoveries in science could be established by proofs, and defended them even when apparently opposed to the language of the Koran : the dogmatical interpretation of the Koran must yield to stubborn, undeniable facts in science. I translate it from Ilnjji Khnlfa&#39;s <i>Jihani Nnmu, </i>or View of the World, whero it was introduced by him to onforca the claims of scientific evidence to be received by the faithful.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Know that the differences of opinion between philosophers and mankind generally are of three kinds. The first kind of difference is simply ft verbal one. As for instance they speak of the maker of tho world as essence or substance <i>(Jouhar), </i>while at the same time, they explain the word to mean that which exists by itself and independent of place.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;The second kind of difference refers to questions, where there is no difference between their system and the principles of our religion, and where there is no occasion of appealing to the prophets in confirmation of the matter in dispute. For instance the philosephers say, that an eclipse of the moon is an indication that its light is obstructed on account of the earth&#39;s coming between it and the sun, seeing that the moon derives its light from the sun, and that the earth is a sphere surrounded by the sky on all sides, and therefore when the moon falls into the shadow of the earth, its light is cut off. The Philosophers alse say that an celipse of the sun arises from the moon&#39;s standing between the observer and the sun, and from a conjunction of the two nt the samo moment.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;The same may be said in regard to this language as was observed in reference to the disputes about words,&#8212; that one need not be anxious about refuting it. Whoever imagines that it is a religious duty to dispute upon this subject, has in fact attacked religion, and injured his own cause. For in truth these positions are fortified by<span class='gtxt_body'>
mathematical proofs, about which there can bo no doubt. Whoever investigates an eolipse, can establish it by .!..:uonstration, and can point out its peculiarities, the period of its commencement, the extent of it, and the period of duration until the rc&#39;illumiuation begins. And if some one tell him that the demonstration, is contrary to doctrine, let him not doubt the demonstration, but rather let him doubt the interpretation given to the law (of the Koran). The wrong done to the law by those who defend it with false interpretations, is greater than the wrong which is done to it by those who find fault with it on a correct interpretation,&#8212; as says the proverb, &#39;a wise enemy is better than a foolish friend.&#39;</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;If somc persen should argue, that as according to a tradition, the Prophet oucc said, &#39; When God manifests his glory upon anything, it humbles itself before it,&#39; and that therefore this is to be taken as an indication that an eclipse arises from an act of humility in the presence of God, we reply, that this report is not a genuine tradition, and that even on the supposition of its genuineness, it would be better to throw light upon its meaning, than to make use of it for altercation in categorical premises. For when the proofs are&#39; definite, we ought not to be controlled to such an extent by unexplained texts of the Koran. It is a cause of great joy to the infidel when the apologist for the faith pretends that such views are contrary to the faith, for it then makes it easy for him to refute the law. The world is cow disputing whether it is a genuine tradition or merely ancient, lint if its genuineness should be established, it would still be a matter of indifference, whether the earth were round or flat, or whether the heavens above and what is below are more or less than thirteen layers &#8212; seeing the thing sought to be proved is, that at any rate they are all the work of God.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;We come next to the third difference of opinion, in which the matters disputed about arc at the foundation of religion, as the creation of the world, the attributes of the creator, and the resurrection of the body. In this case it is without doubt our duty to relute the error with convincing arguments.&quot;</p>
