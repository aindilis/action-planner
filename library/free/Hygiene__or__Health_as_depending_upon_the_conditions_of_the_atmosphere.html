<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>PREFACE,</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt"><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Hygiene </span></span>has been denned to be that branch of medicine the end and aim of which are to point out the conditions on which health depends, and the means by which that inestimable blessing may be sustained in all its purity and entirety.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt">Hygiene </span>embraces, therefore, all those matters which, when in a normal condition, and properly used, contribute to make up, to perfect, and to sustain health; but which, on the contrary, when abused, retained, taken in excess, in insufficient quantity, or in a vitiated or corrupt state, lead to disorder or disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This division of the healing art, under the name of &quot;<span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Non-naturals,&quot; </span>received at the hands of the ancient physicians, so far, at least, as their limited knowledge would admit, the greatest attention and consideration.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By the term <i>&quot;non-naturals&quot; </i>were understood all those things which are <i>essential to life, </i>but which<span class='gtxt_body'>
<i>neither enter into the composition of the animal (Economy, nor form part of the living body. </i></span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>These comprehend <i>air, foods and drinks, motion and rest, sleep and wakefulness, secretions, excretions, and retentions, mental emotions, clothing, bathing, 8fc. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Non-naturals formed, either in part, or as a whole, the subjects of numerous essays and dissertations. Hippocrates has left us a treatise, Ile/jt <i>&#39;Aepav, TBdrcov, <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Km </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Tottcov, </span></i>an example which was followed by Galen, Aetius, Hhases, Avicenna, Celsus, and others, and, in later times, by Sennertus, Blanchard, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>These primitive efforts to attain to a due knowledge and accurate estimate of the beneficence, wisdom, and design in creation, of the adaptation of means to the end, and of those universal, fixed, and immutable laws upon the due observance of which health and life depend, and upon the violation of or departure from which disorder, disease, or death ensues, though worthy of respectful consideration, are frequently obscured by, and inextricably interwoven with, the fanciful speculations, the theoretical opinions, and peculiar dogmas of each period.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The rapid strides, however, which natural philosophy, chemistry, and physiology have made during<span class='gtxt_body'>
the last quarter of a century in the hands of Faraday, Prout, Humboldt, Owen, and other savans, both of this and other countries, have rendered clear, intelligible, and easy of demonstration, much which before existed but as random guesses and as glimmerings in the dark.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>This advance of modern science, and the simultaneous march of civilization, having outstripped alike the writings and the theories of the &quot;old fathers&quot; of physic, a manifest deficiency has arisen in the literature of this branch of medicine, which the author ventures to hope he may, in some measure at least, contribute to supply.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On matters of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Hygiene </span>we have in this country no standard authority, no single work, no condensed summary, no manual even, to which to refer. Its immutable and life-giving principles are scattered through piles of volumes, rich in all the mysteries and wonders of creation and of science, but on which, be our resources never so ample, we have often the greatest toil and the utmost difficulty to fasten.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is to endeavour to supply this desideratum that the writer has ventured to embody all that seems to be necessary to be acquired on those various subjects which make up and constitute <span class="gstxt_hlt">Hygiene. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The necessity for a treatise on this subject has become more apparent since the examining boards of both branches of the public service, the army and navy, of the East India Company&#39;s medical service, of the University of London, and other licensing bodies, have proclaimed their opinions of the importance of a due knowledge of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Hygiene, </span>by making it one of the subjects of examination of the candidate for a commission, or for their degree in, or licence to practise medicine.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The author&#39;s aim is to present to his professional brethren, to the medical student, and to the public at large, a plain and faithful transcript of accurate research, observation, and experience, a simple and exact statement of facts and of admitted truths, together with such inferences and deductions as the subject may appear to warrant and demand.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. <i>Earth, form of.</i>&#8212;The planet which we inhabit is an elliptical spheroid of rotation, of which the lesser axis passes through the poles. The measure of oblateness of the polar diameter is <span class="gstxt_sub">2</span>^th. The polar semidiameter is about 2&#163; geographical miles shorter than the equatorial semidiameter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. <i>Earth, density of. </i>&#8212; The mean density of the earth, according to Reich, is 5&#39;44, or nearly 5&#163; times greater than pure water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. <i>Earth revolves on its own axis, and travels in its orbit.</i>&#8212; The earth <i>revolves </i>on its own axis at the incredible rate at the equator of upwards of 1,000 miles an hour; and <i>travels </i>in its orbit at a mean velocity of 68,000 miles in the same space of time. Its <i>diurnal rotation </i>is completed in 86,400 seconds = 24 hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. <i>Earth surrounded by an atmosphere.</i>&#8212;It is surrounded by an <i>atmosphere </i>(from ar^o?, &quot;vapour,&quot; and <i>a-cpalpa, </i>&quot;a globe,&quot;) or envelope of an admixture of gases, which is indispensable to animal and vegetable life.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. <i>Atmosphere revolves with the earth.</i>&#8212;The atmosphere revolves with the earth by <i>t\\e </i>influence of <i>attraction, </i>which the latter exerts upon it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. Were the atmosphere to cease to be attracted by the earth during the diurnal rotation of the latter on its axis&#8212; were it, in fact, to become motionless, and the earth to revolve within it, it would offer a resistance to the movement of the latter which would hurl in one universal desolation every living thing, plant, and habitation of man.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. <i>Atmosphere, ubiquity and unvarying constitution of.</i>&#8212;The composition of the atmosphere is extremely <i>uniform, </i>if not <i>identical, in all parts of the world, at all elevations, at all seasons, </i>and nearly <i>in all weathers. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>9. <i>Atmosphere, chemical constituents of.</i>&#8212;Atmospheric air is a <i>mechanical mixture, not </i>a <i>chemical compound, </i>consisting of 79-2 parts, by <i>measure, </i>of nitrogen or azote, and 208 parts of oxygen. If the calculation be made by <i>weight, </i>there will be in every 100 measures, 77 of nitrogen and 23 of oxygen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>10. According to the atomic theory, atmospheric air is a mixture of one atom or equivalent of oxygen = 8, and two of nitrogen = 14 x 2 = 28.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>11. The different gases of which the atmosphere is composed consist of molecules of definite size and form, endowed with self-repulsion: they obey the laws which govern the general <i>diffusion </i>of gaseous bodies. The molecules of each gas are equally diffused throughout the whole extent of the atmosphere, and hence its nearly <i>uniform composition. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>12. <i>Atmosphere, adventitious ingredients of.</i>&#8212;Minute quantities of other ingredients likewise enter into the composition of the atmosphere, the quantity of which is liable to vary. Of these, <i>carbonic acid </i>and <i>aqueous vapour </i>are the most constant and important. In 10,000 volumes of air M. de Saussure found only 4-15 (or 3&#39;15 the minimum, 5-74 the maximum) volumes of carbonic acid, or less than 0-1 per cent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>13. The atmosphere contains from one to one and a half per cent, of water in a state of elastic vapour, forming an independent atmosphere, <i>mixed, </i>but <i>not combined with </i>or <i>dissolved </i>in the air. One hundred cubic inches of atmospheric air at 57&#176; of Fahrenheit&#39;s thermometer are capable of retaining 0-35 grains of watery vapour: in this state the air may be considered at its maximum of humidity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>14. The quantity of vapour in an aerial atmosphere can never exceed, though it may be less than, the quantity which is proper to the temperature of the air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>15. As an average <i>jof </i>results, the ordinary constituents of the atmosphere appear to be in the following proportions:&#8212;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>17. M. Fresenius has also found that 1,000,000 parts of atmospheric air contain, during the day, 098 parts of ammonia, a quantity equivalent to 0-283 parts of carbonate of ammonia; and, during the night, 0-169 parts of ammonia, equivalent to 0-474 parts of the carbonate. Much importance is attached to the presence of ammoniacal vapour in the air, as the source of nitrogen in vegetables.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>18. The atmosphere of large cities contains also traces of sulphurous and sulphuric acid, sulphate of ammonia, carbonaceous matter, and sulphuretted hydrogen. Minute traces of free hydrogen and carburetted hydrogen (fire-damp, or marshgas), incessantly evolved by stagnant waters and marshes, have been observed. In the vicinity of the sea, and especially during storms, the <i>rain </i>contains traces of salts; and, during thunderstorms, affords slight indications of nitric acid and nitrate of ammonia.</p>

From the manner in which these appear to be decomposed and destroyed by chlorine, it is not improbable that they consist of some organic or hydrogenated compounds.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>32.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>34. Pascal, in 1646, filled with <i>water </i>a glass tube 46 feet in length, hermetically sealed at one end, and inverted the open end in a cistern of the same fluid. The water in the tube, after its oscillations had subsided, was sustained at a height of 34 feet above the surface of that in the reservoir. Torricelli, in the same year, filled a tube, three feet long, with <i>mercury, </i>and plunged the open end in a vessel of that metal. The mercury in the tube fell to about 30 inches above the level of that in the basin.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>35. It was thus ascertained that the column of <i>water </i>34 feet high, as well as that of the <i>mercury </i>30 inches high, exactlycounterpoised a column of air of an equal base, extending from the sea level to the top of the atmosphere. And further, that as a column of mercury 30 inches high, every one of whose sides measures one inch, weighs nearly ldlbs., or, more accurately, 14&#39;75lbs. so a column of air, with its aqueous vapour, of like area, extending from the surface of the sea to the top of the atmosphere, <i>presses </i>upon the former with a weight of 14-75lbs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>36. Pascal, in 1647, originated the idea, and was the first to observe, that if the atmospheric pressure were diminished or increased by any disturbing causes, by rarefied or by denser atmosphere, by elevation or descent, the mercury in the tube would fall or rise in a corresponding degree.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>37. The Barometer, the name by which the instrument invented by Torricelli is known <i>(from fiapos &quot;weight&quot; andfierpov &quot;measure&quot;), </i>is therefore employed to measure the heights of mountains and other elevated localities. This would, indeed, be a very simple matter were the atmosphere, in ascending from stratum to stratum, <i>homogeneous, </i>or of <i>one uniform density; </i>for, as a column of mercury 30 inches high has the same weight as a column of air of an equal base, extending <i>from the level of the sea to the top of the atmosphere </i>(35), and as the weight of the mercury, bulk for bulk, is 11,065 times greater than that of air (28), it results that the height of a column of air, as <i>heavy as the column of mercury, </i>must be 11,065 times greater than the latter, or 27662-5 feet, or 5-2391 miles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>38. But as it will be shown that the height of the atmosphere extends from 45 to 50 miles (99 to 107)&#8212;indeed it has been said to exceed 75 miles&#8212;it is evident that, in order to construct a formula for ascertaining the heights of mountains, &amp;c. it is necessary to take into account&#8212;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>39. As the <i>weight </i>of the column of air at the upper station is <i>diminished </i>in proportion to the amount of elevation, so is the <i>height </i>of the column of mercury <i>lessened </i>in a corresponding degree.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>40. Did the temperature and force of gravity remain unaltered, and were the density of the air the same at all heights, the logarithms of the atmospheric pressures corresponding to different altitudes would <i>decrease </i>in arithmetical progression as the pressures themselves decrease, and as the altitudes <i>increase </i>in arithmetical proportion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>But as the pressure taken off by the ascent is derived from that portion of the atmosphere which is the most dense, and at which the force of gravity is the greatest, this must be considered in the construction of the formula.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>41. Laplace, Lindenau, Ramond, Trembley, Roy, Deluc, Shuckburgh, and others, have given us formula? for ascertaining, with as much accuracy as possible, the heights of elevated localities.</p>

For every inch of variation of the barometric column, tha boiling point of water varies <i>l&#39;7G&#176; </i>Fall., consequently every tenth of an inch which the barometer rises or falls elevates or depresses the boiling point by about 0-176&#176; Fah.</p>

It occurred to Mr. Fahrenheit that advantage might be taken of this fact to ascertain the height of mountains; and with this view he proposed that, in order to find the difference, ha feet, between the upper and lower stations, pure water should be boiled in an open vessel at both stations, and the <i>difference </i>of temperature at which it boils should be multiplied by 530, which will give a close approximation to the height of the upper above the lower station. From the <i>conjoined </i>temperatures of the atmosphere at the two stations 64&#176; are to be subtracted, and the remainder is to be multiplied by the One-thousandth part of the height already found, to which it is to be added. This is the correction for the difference of the temperature at the two stations. A further correction is necessary for the figure of the earth, and the latitude of the place.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The aneroid barometer (from <i>avev, </i>&quot;<i>without&quot; </i>pooSS?;?, &quot;fluid,&quot;) consists of a flat circular metallic box, 4&#163; inches in diameter, and If inches thick, containing an <i>exhausted </i>copper drum, of which the corrugated upper plate or head is exceedingly thin. From the centre of this upper plate springs an upright metallic shaft, which, as it rises or falls by the varying amount of <i>atmospheric pressure </i>exercised on the drum-head, multiplies, by means of levers and springs of an ingenious and complicated workmanship attached to its upper end, the delicate movements thus propagated to it, and which are marked by an index traversing a dial graduated to correspond in inches and tenths with the scale of the mercurial barometer.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>88. Gay Lussac, at an elevation of 22,902 feet above the level of the sea, found the temperature to have diminished as much as 725&#176; of Fahrenheit. This, supposing the decrease of temperature to be uniform, gives a diminution of 1&#176; Fah. for every 315 feet of elevation. The fall is, however, more rapid in the higher than in the lower regions, in consequence of the increased capacity for heat possessed by air, in proportion as it becomes more rare (65). In that part of the Andes which lies within the tropics, Humboldt found Fahrenheit&#39;s thermometer indicated a fall of 0 9&#176; for every 288 feet of perpendicular elevation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>89. Lindenau, Euler, and Oriani suppose the temperature of the atmosphere to diminish in harmonic progression through a series of heights increasing in arithmetical proportion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>90. The mean results of a great number of observations, made in different parts of the world, appear to show, that for every 300 feet of altitude Fahrenheit&#39;s thermometer <i>sinks one degree. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>91. Contrary, however, to the general rule, it has been ascertained by M. Pictet, Mr. Six, and Dr. Wells, that on <i>clear and calm nights </i>the temperature of the atmosphere <i>increases </i>with the distance from the earth. Mr. Six has established the fact that the atmosphere at the height of 220 feet is often, upon <i>such nights, </i>10&#176; warmer than that 7 feet above the ground. This is accounted for by the earth&#39;s surface radiating a portion of the heat acquired during the day, thereby occasioning the deposition, in the form of dew, of a portion of the aqueous vapour suspended in the superincumbent atmosphere.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>92. The temperature of the atmosphere at all elevations is inversely as the capacity of air possessing the rarity due to the given altitude.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The same absolute measure of heat exists at all heights. Its apparent decrease proceeds wholly from that enlargement of capacity which the attenuated fluid acquires (65).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>93. For every additional degree of heat air expands, and for</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>94. As an illustration of the foregoing calculations, we may instance the Hospice of the Grand St. Bernard, 7,668 feet above the sea level, in 45&#176; 51&#39; N. lat., of which last the mean annual temperature is 57-65&#176;. Required, the mean annual temperature of the Hospice, and the place, the mean annual temperature of which at the sea level will coincide with that of the Hospice.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Divide the height of the Hospice, 7,668 feet, by 300, which number of feet produces a fall of 1&#176; of Fahrenheit&#39;s thermometer (90) = 25-56 x 1&#176; = 25-56&#176; Fah., which being subtracted from 57-65&#176;, gives 32-09&#176; for the <i>mean annual temperature </i>of the Hospice, which coincides very nearly with that of the Pole.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Again, it has been stated (83), on the authority of Humboldt, that between the 38th and 71st parallels the temperature varies 0-9&#176; Fah. for each degree of latitude. On reference to the table of mean temperature (98), it will be seen that between 40&#176; and 70&#176; this variation is only 0-8&#176;; between 70&#176; and 80&#176;, 0-453&#176;; and between 80&#176; and 90&#176; only 0-157&#176;, for each degree of latitude.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>presumption in favour of the finite extent of the atmosphere. But supposing the particles of atmospheric air capable of division to an infinite degree throughout all space, it by no means follows that this attenuated medium is common air, or anything approaching to it, in the proportion of its density to its elastic power.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>103. Again, as the several strata of the atmosphere must, as they recede from the earth&#39;s axis, necessarily revolve with a velocity infinitely greater than that at the level of the sea, it would result that the centrifugal force at the equator, at high * elevations, would speedily overcome the attraction of gravity, and cause the molecules composing the atmosphere to fly off.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>104. Another supposition in favour of a <i>finite </i>atmosphere is derived from the rapid <i>decrease of temperature </i>which takes place as we recede from the surface of the earth (87, 88, 90). Assuming that every 600 feet of elevation produces a fall of only one degree of Fahrenheit&#39;s thermometer, it follows that, at a height of forty miles above the sea level, the temperature of the air would be 350&#176; of Fahrenheit below that of the sea, or certainly more than 300&#176; below the freezing point. No gas with which we are acquainted would preserve its gaseous state at this low temperature, but would become liquid.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>105. Poisson, however, considers it possible that as all gases, by reduction of temperature, may be rendered solid, so may the atmosphere, by becoming more attenuated, and more and more cold, attain to a point at which it would freeze; and, in accordance with this theory, he advances the supposition that the uppermost surface of the atmosphere is covered by a transparent pellicle of ice.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>106. The temperature of <i>space </i>has been computed by Baron Fourier and other philosophers to be about &#8212;57&#176;, &#8212;58&#176; of Fahrenheit&#39;s scale, or 90&#176; below the freezing point of water; a</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>107. Poisson&#39;s supposition is therefore visionary and untenable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>108. It may be laid down that, so far as animal life is concerned, the limits of the atmosphere do not exceed three miles. Beyond this, the rapidity of the movements of the circulatory and respiratory systems would speedily wear out the machinery and exhaust the powers of life.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>111. Throughout the world there are two daily atmospheric tides.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Within the tropics the <i>flow </i>of the atmospheric tide, according to Humboldt, takes place with the greatest regularity at 9 or 9J <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>A.m., </span>and at 10 or 10f <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>P.m.</span>; and the <i>ebb </i>at 4 or 4| <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>P.m., </span>and at 4 A.M.

<p class='gtxt_body'>With so much regularity do these changes take place, that the time of day may be ascertained by the oscillations of tho mercurial column without much chance of error.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>112. The regularity of this ebb and flow of the atmosphere within the tropica is not disturbed by tempests of thunder or of wind, or by rain, or by earthquakes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>113. The amount of the daily fluctuation of the barometric column consequent upon the varying pressure of the atmosphere diminishes, by 1-32 line, to 0&#39;18 line, from the equator to 70&#176; north latitude. Much nearer the pole the mean height of the barometer is actually less at 10 <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>A.m. </span>than at 4 <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>P.m. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>114. The mean height of the barometer is somewhat less under the equator and the tropics than in the temperate zone. It appears to attain its maximum in the West of Europe in the parallels of 40<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span> and 45&#176;.</p>

Their movements are sensibly felt by the barometer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On the 9th of October, 1849, the anterior trough of a wave passed over London; the crest on the 13th, and the posterior trough on the 18th. On this day the reading of the barometer was 1333 inch less than on the passage of the crest.

<p class='gtxt_body'>118. They tend to equalize the temperature of the surface of the globe.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>119. Winds may be divided into <i>constant, periodical, </i>and <i>variable. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>120. The general currents of the atmosphere depend principally on the disproportionate temperature of the equator and of the poles; and on the diurnal rotation of the earth on its axis.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>121. The mean temperature of the equator has been shown to be upwards of 81&#176; Fah. (71); that of the poles to be constantly below 32&#176; Fah. (70, 98). Hence, as the atmosphere of the equator is expanded and rendered specifically lighter by heat, so the colder and heavier atmosphere of the poles rushes towards the equator in a perpendicular direction, to supply its place; the lighter equatorial air so displaced ascends to the top of the atmosphere and flows towards the poles. The rotation, however, of the earth on its axis from west to east, deflects, on account of the increased velocity of the parallels of latitude near the equator, which have greater radii than the arctic parallels, the currents of polar air from their northern and southern course, and produces, on the north side of the equator, a north-easterly current, and, on the south side of the equator, a south-easterly current, both of which, as they approach the equator, gradually become more nearly parallel to it, or east. To these the name of&quot; <i>Trade </i>Winds &quot; has been given. To the lighter equatorial currents, whose general</p>

In their progress onwards these take a more and more <i>westerly </i>direction, from the same cause which produced in the polar air an <i>easterly </i>course, the rotation of the earth, until they become nearly west.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>122. Westerly, or W.S.W. winds, in both temperate zones, are, therefore, the prevailing counter currents to the trade or east winds of the tropics.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>123. The north-east trade wind blows between 9&#176; and 27&#176; north latitude; and the south-east trade wind prevails between 3&#176; north latitude and 25&#176; south latitude.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>124. A belt of five or six degrees of latitude in breadth, the <i>region of calms, </i>separates the opposite lower trade winds. Here calms and rains prevail, sometimes alternating with the most frightful storms, caused probably by the mingling and ascending of the opposite aerial currents. This zone of calms, the hottest of the earth, exercises a powerful influence in the production of the trade winds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>125. <i>Periodical winds, or monsoons.</i>&#8212;These winds blow half the year in one direction, and half the year in the opposite direction. These and the <i>constant </i>winds blow only <i>at sea. </i>High lands change or interrupt their course, and hence, <i>on land, </i>the wind is always <i>variable. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>126. These periodical winds are only a modification of the trade winds, produced by the peculiar form of the countries lying within and around the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>127. The <i>north-east </i>monsoon blows from October to April, and the south-east monsoon from April to October.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>128. <i>Whirlwinds.</i>&#8212;Whirlwinds are violent movements of the atmosphere in a circular or spiral direction about an axis, the latter having at the same time a progressive motion, rectilinear or curvilinear, on the surface of the land or sea.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>129. Whirlwinds arise when two winds are blowing near each other in opposite directions. The more powerful wind will by degrees draw into its own movement the weaker current, which first, however, suffers a certain amount of condensation: the greater the degree of this condensation, the greater will be the speed with which this weaker current will be drawn into the more powerful movement; and, being continually turned from its course, and always in the same direction, it must of necessity take a twisting, whirling, or gyratory motion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>130. <i>Storms.</i>&#8212;These are whirlwinds moving onwards in a certain direction.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>131. <i>Hurricanes </i>or <i>tornados.</i>&#8212;These arise where the belt of the <i>trade winds </i>passes into that of the <i>calms. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>132. The <i>typhoons </i>of the China Sea owe their origin and direction to causes similar to those which operate in producing the hurricanes of the West Indies.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>133. It has been established by Dove and Reid that in all or most great storms the wind has a <i>rotatory </i>movement.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>134. The diameter of the circle within which the gyration is performed is sometimes equal in extent to several hundred miles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>135. The onward march is at the rate of from forty to forty-eight miles per hour, and the velocity of the whirling motion nearly double.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>136. It has been calculated that this velocity of the atmosphere exerts a pressure of thirty-two pounds on the square foot. Mr. Smeaton, however, calculates the pressure at 49&#39;2 pounds, and the velocity at 146-7 feet per second, or at 100 miles per hour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>137. In Western Europe storms generally come from the south-west, and arise from the struggle of a powerful southwest current with one blowing from the north-east.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>142. Mr. Hingeston suggests that the causes of the violence of the winds, if not their directions, are electro-magnetic, and that the partial rarefaction of the air by heat, and its condensation by cold, hitherto employed for explaining the force and current of the winds, are most likely only striking parts of terrestrial electro-magnetism.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Of the Aqueous Vapour of the Atmosphere. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>143. Dr. Dalton has shown that the actual quantity of vapour which can exist in any given space depends entirely upon <i>temperature; </i>and that the amount of aqueous vapour contained in the atmosphere <i>increases with the temperature, </i>and varies with the hour, season, latitude, and height above the sea level.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Dr. Thomson says that 94450 cubic miles of water circulate annually through the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>144. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, and quarter of the wind, are all most intimately connected with the vivifying moisture of the air; and, this <i>quality, </i>with the manner, frequency, and nature of the precipitation, whether as dew, fog, rain, or snow.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>147. The <i>dryness </i>of air is <i>doubled </i>at <i>every increase </i>of temperature corresponding to 27&#176; of Fahrenheit&#39;s scale, and in proportion for all intermediate temperatures. Thus, at the freezing point, air is capable of holding the hundred and sixtieth part of its weight of moisture; at 59&#176; the eightieth part; at 86&#176; the fortieth part; at 113&#176; the twentieth part; and at 140&#176; the tenth part. Whilst the temperature, therefore, advances uniformly in arithmetical progression, the dissolving power which this communicates to the air mounts with the accelerating rapidity of a geometrical series.</p>

Hence it follows that, whatever be the actual condition of a mass of air, there must always exist <i>some temperature </i>at which it will become <i>perfectly damp, </i>and <i>another </i>at which it will begin to deposit its combined moisture. Thus air, at the temperature of 86&#176; in a state of absolute satux<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>ation, would, if cooled to 59&#176;, part with the fortieth part of its weight in the form of rain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>149. The dryness of the air is, under all circumstances, precisely indicated by the depression of temperature produced on a humid surface which has been freely exposed to its action.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>150. <i>Dew </i>is occasioned by the earth radiating after sunset a portion of its superfluous temperature into the surrounding space; the air immediately in contact with the surface becomes <i>cooled below the point of saturation, </i>and <i>deposits </i>a <i>portion </i>of its <i>water </i>in the form of dew.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>calm </i>and <i>starry </i>nights, and in situations freely exposed to the atmosphere, because radiation and cooling take place then more quickly than when the sky is clouded.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On <i>cloudy </i>nights dew is never observed on plants elevated a few feet from the ground.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>152. Dew is deposited much less copiously on hills than upon plains, in consequence of the cooling of the atmosphere being much more considerable on the latter than on the former.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>153. In <i>every clear </i>and <i>calm night </i>the temperature of the atmosphere <i>increases </i>with the distance from the earth to the height of at least 220 feet.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In <i>still </i>and <i>serene </i>weather the temperature of the air, a <i>few feet </i>above the earth, will sometimes <i>decrease, </i>even in this country, 18 or 20 degrees between sunset and sunrise, though no change of wind has in the mean time occurred.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Or, in other words, the dew point is that temperature to which the existing state of the atmosphere must be cooled before rain descend.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>167. <i>Mists, </i>like dew, are the result of the cooling by radiation of the lower strata of the atmosphere. They originate in the vapours which arise from water, and from the surface of the earth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>168. <i>Fogs.</i>&#8212;The formation of fogs differs from that of dew, in that they usually arise from the influence which air cooled by radiation exerts on warmer air; or, in other words, from the intermixture of air of different temperatures. The surface of lakes, ponds, and rivers, are frequently, in calm weather, covered with fog in the early morning, in consequence of the temperature of the water during the night being above that of the superincumbent air. This latter, becoming warmed by the water, rises surcharged with moisture, which it precipitates in the form of fog upon coming in contact with the cooler air above.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>169. It has been affirmed by M. de Saussure, that <i>mists </i>and <i>fogs (nuages) </i>consist of minute hollow spheres or vesicles of water filled with air, having the quality of mutual repulsion. The movements of these vesicles are exceedingly rapid and fantastic; they chase, fly to, and repel each other in the most grotesque <i>(bizarre) </i>and amusing manner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>170. Their formation and suspension in the air are, indisputably, entirely due to the electricity which they derive from the upper strata of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>171. Mountain fogs are produced by the cold of the sides or summit of the mountain condensing the vapour, which a wind hotter than the mountain itself holds in solution. Tho molecules cf water are precipitated, and take the vesicular form.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>172. M. de Saussure describes the vesicles of an Alpine fog to have been larger than the largest peas, and inconceivably thin.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>174. &quot;It is probable,&quot; says Mr. Glaisher, &quot;that fogs, mist, and haze represent, not mere clouds of aqueous vapour, but other products of terrestrial exhalation, delayed in their transit to space and withheld from the diffusion they had commenced.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>175. Great fogs seldom occur unless the barometer be high.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>176. <i>Clouds.</i>&#8212;Clouds are visible collections of minute globules of water suspended in the atmosphere; or, masses of visible vapour, precisely similar to that composing fogs, but elevated to a considerable height above the earth&#39;s surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>177. The formation of clouds depends altogether on <i>convection, </i>and is the result of an intermixture, in the higher regions of the atmosphere, of strata of air of different temperatures, and in different states of saturation.</p>

The boundary beyond which they can seldom rise, says Professor Leslie, is about two miles above the line of perpetual congelation.</p>

If this be <i>above </i>32&#176; Fahr. the vapour separated will fall to the earth in the state of ram; if below 32&#176;, of sleet, snow, or hail.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For instance, if equal bulks of air, in a state of saturation, the one at 59&#176;, the other at 113&#176;, be intermingled, the resulting compound will have a mean temperature of 86&#176;. But, as the elastic force of vapour at 59&#176; is &#39;507 inch, it follows that air at that temperature would suspend about the eightieth part of its weight of vapour; and at 113&#176; it would suspend the twentieth part of its weight, the elastic tension of vapour at that temperature being 2-75 inches. The mean temperature of the two would be 86&#176;, and the mean of their elasticities 1*6285 inches. As however air at 86&#176; can only suspend the fortieth part of its weight, its tension being 1-21 inch only, the difference, &#8226;4185 inch, amounting to a hundred and sixtieth of the whole weight of the air, must be precipitated from the compound mass.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>199. If, in its descent, the separated moisture pass through a stratum of air warmer than the mean of the two from which it had been precipitated, it may be suspended in this warmer current, and may not reach the ground.

Assuming the mean annual quantity of rain for the whole globe to be 34 inches, the quantity of rain falling annually will amount to somewhat more than 91,751 cubic miles of water, and the quantity falling on the dry land to 30,960 cubic miles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>219. The mean annual evaporation over the whole surface of the globe has been computed by Dr. Thomson and Dr. Dalton at 35 inches, which gives 94,450 cubic miles for the water annually evaporated over the whole globe.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>225. The rainbow is produced by the sun&#39;s rays falling upon the drops of rain near their upper surfaces, where, being refracted, they pass to the side of the drop which is furthest from the sun and the spectator, whence they are reflected towards the lower surface; and, on quitting the drop, they suffer a second refraction. Each pencil of rays on emerging from the drop consists of parallel rays of light, which produces in the mind of the spectator the perception of brightness. Light is therefore <i>twice refracted </i>and <i>once reflected </i>within each drop of rain or vesicle of vapour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>226. Descartes was the first who distinctly explained the cause of the production of the rainbow; but it was left for Sir Isaac Newton, after he had discovered the different degrees of refrangibility in the various coloured rays which compose a pencil of white or compounded light, to assign the cause of the coloured bands in the rainbow, the order of their position, and the breadth which they must occupy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>227. As the rainbow can only be seen when the clouds precipitating the rain are opposite the sun, it follows that a <i>morning </i>bow, in the south-west, portends, with a south-west wind, the approach of rain, and, with an easterly wind, that it is passing away. An <i>evening </i>bow in the east, with a southwest wind, indicates fair weather, and that the rain has passed away; but, with an easterly wind, that it is approaching.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>231. According to Descartes they are caused by the refraction of light in small equilateral prisms of ice which float in the air; and to Dechales, in the aqueous (vesicular?) vapour of the atmosphere, the colours of the rainbow appearing in those drops which are 23 degrees distant from the luminary. M. Mariotte is of opinion that small coronas are formed by the transmission of light through aqueous vapours, in which it suffers two refractions without any intermediate reflection.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>232. Descartes observed that halos are never seen when rain is falling.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>244.

<p class='gtxt_body'>265. At the temperature of 62&#176; Fah. the velocity of sound has been determined by Sir John Herschel to be 1125 feet per second = 12-784 miles per minute. Every increase or decrease of temperature of 1&#176; of Fahrenheit&#39;s scale occasions a corresponding increase or decrease of 1/14 foot per second in the velocity of sound. At 32&#176; Fah. sound travels at the rate of 1090-8 feet per second.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>266. De l&#39;lsle once counted 72 seconds between the lightning and the thunder. Assuming the temperature of the air to have been only 45&#176; Fah., the velocity of sound would be 1105-62 feet in every second of time. Seventy-two seconds multiplied by 1105-62 feet, gives 14-07 miles as the distance of the cloud in which the lightning appeared.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Each ray of light consists of three separate rays, a ray of <i>heat, </i>a ray of <i>light, </i>and a ray of <i>actinism </i>(from <i>cucriv, </i>a ray). Mr. R. Hunt, to whom we are indebted for the discovery of the actinic ray, has shown that this is necessary to germination and vegetation. In spring, during germination, and the budding of trees and plants, the solar beams abound with these rays; in summer, during the formation of the woody portions of plants, the light-giving rays prevail; and in autumn, the calorific, heat-giving, or ripening principle of the solar ray is increased.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Yellow glass is impervious to the actinic ray.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>285. It has been calculated that a vertical ray of light in its passage through the clearest air loses at least a fifth part of its intensity before it reaches the earth&#39;s surface; and that, of a thousand rays emanating from the sun, only 378, on an average, can penetrate to the surface of the earth at the equator; 228 at the latitude of 45&#176;; and 110 at the poles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>286. Euler has calculated the <i>light </i>emitted by the sun to be equal to that of 6560 candles at one foot distance. Leslie considers it 12,000 times more powerful than that of a wax candle; in other words, if a portion of the luminous solar matter rather less than half an inch in diameter, were transferred to our planet, it would throw forth a blaze of light equal to the effect of twelve thousand wax candles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Humboldt, on the other hand, defines the sun to be a dark, black mass.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is now generally admitted that the centre of our system is an opaque body surrounded by a luminous envelope.

<p class='gtxt_body'>287. To the <i>decomposition, refraction, </i>and <i>reflection </i>of light by the vapour of the atmosphere, we are indebted for the caerulean tint of the sky, and all the splendid colouring of the clouds, nay, even for the light of day itself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>288. &quot;The primary source of <i>heat,&quot; </i>says Professor Leslie, &quot;is the sun, whose genial rays are partly detained in the atmosphere, and partly received at the surface of the land and of the ocean.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>289. M. Pouillet has estimated the amount of heat annually received by the earth from the sun to be equal to that which &#8226;would be produced by the combustion of a stratum of coal seventeen miles in thickness, or sufficient to melt a stratum of ice covering its entire surface nearly forty-six feet thick.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>290. Light is indispensably necessary to animal and vegetable life. It produces certain special effects on the respiration of both kingdoms. In the absence of light, plants absorb <i>oxygen, </i>and give off <i>carbonic acid. </i>Animals in the hours of darkness <i>exspire a smaller amount </i>of carbonic acid than during the day. This has been, though erroneously, attributed to sleep. The difference is mainly owing to the absence of sunlight. Animals are more speedily fattened in the dark than in open daylight. From a like cause, though differently induced, healthy individuals about and after the middle periods of life become fat and <i>embonpoint, </i>in consequence of the <i>diminished amount of carbonic acid exhaled from the lungs. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>291. Though this matter belongs more properly to the subsequent divisions of our subject, it may not be altogether irrelevant to state that youthful exercise, by quickening the respiration and circulation, occasions a larger demand for food, a greater consumption of carbon by, and an increased exha</p>

In advanced life, if the pulse and respiration be slow, the effects of diminished exhalation of carbonic acid are counteracted by a failing appetite. In fever, we see the quickened circulation and respiration, the sustained heat, the increased combustion of carbon, the diminished supply, the increased exhalation of carbonic acid from the lungs, combine to produce wasting and emaciation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>292. Men and vegetables deprived of light become etiolated. Of these we have examples in the colourless state of the <i>barbe de moine </i>grown in cellars, and of that portion of our garden celery which has been earthed up in order to exclude light; and of those in the blanched and stunted denizens of cellars, and of alleys, courts, and narrow streets surrounded by lofty buildings, which exclude the cheering and colouring influence of the solar rays.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>293. The backs of fish and quadrupeds exposed to the light are highly coloured; their under-surfaces, on the contrary, are pale or white. The plumage of birds, and the colours of the flowers of tropical climes exposed to the full influence of the solar rays, are gorgeous, deep, and brilliant, and as varied as beautiful. In northern climes the opposite obtains.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>297. Did this increase observe an arithmetical progression, a granite stratum at the depth of <i>5-2 </i>geographical miles would be in a state of fusion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>298. In Europe, between the parallels of 48&#176; and 52&#176;, at a depth of from 55 to 60 feet, a stratum of <i>invariable temperature </i>occurs. In tropical climates this is found to be only one foot below the surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>299. The mean temperature of the earth has not altered by the yyoth part of a thermometrical degree since the age of Hipparchus, full 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>300. <i>Hot Springs. </i>The temperature of the waters of a spring will afford a tolerably accurate idea of the depth of its source.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>301. The temperature accords with that of the stratum in which they have their origin.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>302. Thus, tha temperature of the Spriidel at Carlsbad is 165&#176;, and of the Bath waters 114&#176;. Now, supposing the waters of these springs not to lose any of their temperature in their passage to the surface of the earth, the source of the first will be 54-496 ft. x 165&#176; = 1-703 mile, and of the second 54-496 x 114&#176; = 1-1766 mile, in perpendicular depth.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>308. This gas is insipid, colourless, and inodorous, and is permanently elastic under all known pressures and temperatures.

<p class='gtxt_body'>309. Oxygen is a powerful supporter of combustion and respiration. It is more abundantly diffused throughout nature than any of the other elementary bodies.

<p class='gtxt_body'>314. <i>Nitrogen </i>is a permanently elastic gas at all known temperatures and pressures. It has not any colour, taste, or smell. It is, in the strictest sense of the word, a non-supporter of combustion; it extinguishes instantaneously and perfectly a lighted taper when introduced into it. No animal which respires can therefore live in it, whence it was called by Lavoisier <i>azote </i>(from <i>a privative, </i>and <i>&amp;V&gt; W<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span>)<span class="gstxt_sup">%</span> </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>316. Nitrogen, as it exists in the atmosphere, mixed with oxygen, is absolutely essential to animal life, for no other gas can be substituted for it. Its principal office appears to be to dilute the oxygen. Its destructive effects on animal life do not arise from any inherent poisonous or injurious quality, but are altogether dependent on the absence of oxygen.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>320. When mixed with more than twice its volume of atmospheric air, it ceases to provoke spasm of the <i>rima ghttidis, </i>and may be taken into the lungs, in which case it gives rise to symptoms resembling apoplexy, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>321. Atmospheric air which contains more than ten per cent, of carbonic acid, is quickly destructive of life.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>322. Carbonic acid not only destroys life, by inducing narcotism and fatal stupor, but the muscular fibre of animals killed by it loses its irritability, and is rendered insensible to the stimulus of galvanism.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>323. In consequence of its great specific gravity it occupies the lower parts of wells, caverns, and mines. By miners it is called &quot;<i>choke-damp.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>324. Ten thousand volumes of atmospheric air contain 4-15 of carbonic acid, or less than &#8226;01 per cent. (12).</p>

It is poured forth in vast quantities from numerous and extensive air-springs, the last efforts of volcanic activity, in various parts of the old and new world.

<p class='gtxt_body'>327. Carbonic acid is generated by the combustion of any body containing carbon as one of its component parts, such as coal, wood, oil, tallow, &amp;c. and, also, by the respiration of animals. It is emitted in large quantities by bodies in the state of vinous fermentation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>328. Being also a product of respiration, it is largely generated in crowded, illuminated, and ill-ventilated rooms, where it occasions difficulty of breathing, giddiness, and faintness.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>332. Ozone is a teroxide of hydrogen, consisting of three atoms of oxygen =16 x 3 = 48, and one of hydrogen = 1.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>333.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Scoutellen defines ozone to be oxygen positively electrified.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>miasmata, so incompatible with them, is ozone, that the presence of the latter enables us to affirm the absence of the former, and the healthiness of the locality in which it is found.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>337. Ozone is produced in large quantities over lands covered with luxuriant vegetation, and over water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>338. Ozone is found in abundance on the sea-coast, and on mountains and elevated localities; yet, in reality, it does not progressively increase in quantity in the ratio of elevation, but its diminution or absence in the lower atmospheric strata depends on its destruction by miasmatic emanations with which it has come in contact, and which it has decomposed and rendered inert.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>339. When the mean amount of ozone indicated by the ozonometer on the <i>sea-coast, </i>at an elevation of 85 feet, was 2<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>2, it amounted, <i>inland, </i>at the same elevation, to 0-6; at 170 feet to 1-3, and at 255 feet to 3-8.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>340. Ozone, like the deutoxide of hydrogen, is remarkable for its bleaching properties. Its presence is more strongly marked during the night than in the day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>341. Pure ozone, perhaps on account of its exalted oxidising powers, is a most powerful poison, and when inhaled into the lungs, even in minute doses, produces deleterious effects, and in large doses quickly destroys the strongest animal life.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>342. The inhalation of ozone produces great acceleration of the respiration, a painful constriction of the chest, not unlike asthma, spasm of the bronchial tubes, violent cough, irritation and inflammation of the mucous lining of the bronchiae and air-passages, catarrhs, coryza, possibly &quot;hay-fever,&quot; intense pneumonia, &amp;c. &#8226;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>that a proper admixture of ozone and atmospheric air exercises an important influence on the animal economy, and is indispensably necessary to the due accomplishment of all the vital functions, and to the relief and modification of disorder and disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>345. In confined places, where ozone cannot penetrate, plants and men become blanched; the skin grows pallid, the blood loses colour, lymph predominates, all the tissues soften, and serious diseases of the adynamic type break forth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>346. The presence of ozone in the atmosphere or water is readily detected by test paper prepared by saturating strips of white bibulous paper in a mixture made by boiling one drachm of <i>white </i>starch in an ounce of distilled water for three minutes, in which are to be dissolved, when cold, twelve grains of chemically pure iodide of potassium. The discoloration of paper, thus prepared, to <i>brown, </i>on exposure to the <i>atmosphere, </i>and to <i>purple, </i>when immersed in <i>water, </i>indicates the presence of ozone; the degree of discoloration, its intensity and amount. The change of colour is owing to the oxidation, by the ozone, of the potassium of the iodide, and by the combination of the iodine, thus set free, with the starch, to form an iodide of starch.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>347. To the spherical figure of the earth, to its diurnal revolution on its own axis, and to the obliquity, with respect to the plane of the equator, of its motion in its elliptic orbit, by which every part of its surface between 23&#163; north and south latitudes are in turn exposed to the perpendicular influence of the sun&#39;s rays, are to be ascribed the unequal distribution of heat and light, and the endless variations and vicissitudes of seasons in different latitudes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>348. The year is divided into four seasons of nearly equal duration&#8212;<i>Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>349. The <i>Spring </i>quarter commences <i>astronomically </i>in the northern hemisphere on the day on which th&#171; sun enters the first degree of Aries, about the 20th day of March, or, more strictly, on the day when the distance of the sun&#39;s meridian altitude from the zenith being on the increase is at a mean between the greatest and the least&#8212;the <i>vernal equinox. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>350. The duration of the spring quarter is 93 days.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>351. <i>Summer </i>begins on the day on which the sun enters the first degree of Cancer, about the 21st of June, or, more strictly, on the day on which it has attained its greatest northern declination, or distance from the equator&#8212;the <i>summer solstice. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>352. The duration of the summer quarter is 93 days.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>353. <i>Autumn </i>commences on the day on which the sun enters Libra&#8212;about the 22nd of September, <i>i.e. </i>on the day on which the sun&#39;s meridian distance from the zenith, being on the decrease, is at a mean between the greatest and the least&#8212; the <i>autumnal equinox. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>354. The duration of the autumnal quarter is 90 days.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>355. <i>Winter </i>begins on the day on which the sun enters Capricornus, about the 21st of December, when the sun&#39;s distance from the zenith is greatest&#8212;the <i>winter solstice. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>356. The duration of the winter quarter is 89 days, and in leap-year 90.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>357. At the winter solstice the earth is about 3,000,000 of miles nearer to the sun than at the summer solstice. &quot;As, however,&quot; says Sir J. Herschel, &quot;the momentary supply of heat received by the earth from the sun varies in the exact proportion of the angular velocity, that is, of the momentary increase of longitude, so the greater proximity of the sun in winter is exactly compensated for by the earth&#39;s more rapid motion, and thus an equilibrium of heat is as it were maintained.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>358. The intervals of time between the equinoxes are not equal, the sun&#39;s course in the ecliptic occupying seven more days on the northern than on the southern side of the equator. From the vernal to the autumnal equinox the course is completed in 186 days; from the autumnal to the vernal equinox in 179 days.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>359. The division of the year adopted by the ancients, not only of Greece, but of other countries, differed very materially from that of the present day. The four seasons were of unequal duration, but were all astronomically distinguished.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>360. With the Greeks, <i>Spring </i>began at the vernal equinox, and ended at the heliacal rising of the Vergiliae or Pleiades, about the 7 th of May.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>361. <i>Summer </i>was calculated from the heliacal rising of the Vergiliae, either to the heliacal rising of Arcturus, a star of the first magnitude in the constellation Arctophylax or Bootes,<span class='gtxt_body'>
.which generally occurs about the middle of September, or to the heliacal rising of Sirius or Procyon&#8212;the former a star of the first magnitude in the constellation Canis Major, the latter in Canis Minor.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>362. <i>Autumn </i>commenced at the heliacal rising of Arcturus, of Sirius, or of Procyon, about the 15th of September, and terminated at the heliacal setting of the Vergiliae, which generally takes place about the beginning (5th) of November.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>363. <i>Winter </i>was reckoned from the heliacal setting of the Vergiliae to the vernal equinox.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>364. The duration of the spring quarter was 48 days; of the summer quarter 131 days; of the autumn quarter 51 days; and of the winter quarter 135 days.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>365. It is to be observed that this division of the year had especial reference to the climate of Greece.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>366. &quot;In Egypt, spring obtains during January and February; summer begins in March, and lasts to the end of August; autumn is distributed over September and October; and winter over November and December.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>367. &quot;Physicians,&quot; says Sennertus, &quot; do not calculate the seasons by the sun&#39;s course, but by the temperature of the atmosphere. Spring is that season in which the constitution of the air is mild; summer, that in which it is hot and dry; autumn, that in which it is cold and dry; winter, that in which it is cold and humid.&quot; &quot;Winter and summer are each distributed over four months and ten days; the spring over two months and some days; and the autumn over scarcely two months. In many septentrional and temperate regions, spring</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>861. All antiquity attributed an evil influence to the dog-star. Its heliacal rising was coincident with the overflow of the Nile, and with the oppressive and unhealthy forty days Etesian winds. The real classical dog-days are the twenty days preceding and following its heliacal rising.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>does not commence until after the vernal equinox; summer does not last four months; autumn commences before the heliacal rising of Arcturus; whilst the winter is scarcely able to accomplish five months.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>368. The seasons, if the following lines from Lydiat may be received as evidence, were tolerably equally divided, and commenced a month earlier than the present corresponding astronomical quarters:&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'><i>Bat Clemens hyemem: dat Petrus ver Cathedratus: </i><br/><i>JEstuat TTrbanus: autumnat Barthelomens. </i><br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Thus, winter began on the 23rd of November, spring on the 22nd February, summer on the 25th May, and autumn on the 24th August.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>369. The seasons of the poet and of the agriculturalist have little in common with the arbitrary divisions of the zodiacal year, but everything in common with Nature. She herself mocks at these astronomical anachronisms. Spring is carolled in with the first burst of vegetation and the pairing of the feathered tribe. The snowdrop, crocus, modest primrose, rear their heads, and the raven and the blackbird hatch their young, during the astronomical &quot;winter quarter.&quot; Hay harvest commences and early fruits are gathered in the astronomical &quot;spring quarter.&quot; The luxuriant vine groans beneath the juicy grape, and wheat, barley, and hops are got in, during &quot;summer;&quot; whilst &quot;autumn&quot; is more especially remarkable for its snow and ice.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>370. The astronomical division of the year would approach more nearly to nature were the spring quarter to commence at a point of the ecliptic equidistant from the winter solstice and the vernal equinox, viz. on the 3rd of February, and terminate at a corresponding point between the vernal equinox and summer solstice, on the 5th of May. The summer quarter would commence on this day, and end on the 6th August, on which day the autumnal quarter would commence: this would termi<span class='gtxt_body'>nate on the 5th November, on which day the winter quarter would begin.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The advantages of this division would be that the vernal equinox, equal day and night, would be placed in the <i>middle </i>of the spring quarter; the summer solstice, the longest day, <i>mid-summer, </i>in the <i>middle, </i>and <i>not at the commencement, </i>of the summer quarter; the autumnal equinox, equal day and night, would be found in the middle of the autumnal quarter; and the winter solstice, the shortest day, in the middle of the winter quarter, and not at the commencement as now. The spring quarter would consist of 91 days, instead of 93; summer of 93 days, as now; autumn of 91, instead of 90; and winter of 90, instead of 89.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>371. Mr. Luke Howard suggests that the respective seasons should commence <i>fifteen </i>days <i>before </i>the equinoxes and solstices, in order that the yearly circle of the <i>varying temperature </i>may be divided into four symmetrical parts, more nearly corresponding with our <i>leafing </i>spring, <i>flowering </i>summer, <i>fruit-bearing </i>autumn, and <i>dormant naked </i>winter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>372. The great father of physic, in his treatise Ile/H <i>&#39;Aepav, <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>&quot;tmtwv, </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Kox </span>Tonrav, </i>sets out by stating that whoever would investigate medicine properly, and practise it successfully, should first consider the <i>seasons </i>of the year, and their different effects; the <i>winds </i>common to all countries, and those peculiar to each locality; the <i>aspect </i>of towns and cities in relation to the winds and rising of the sun; whether the <i>ground </i>be naked and deficient in water, or wooded and well-watered; and whether situate in a hollow confined locality, or on an elevated and cold site.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>373. That the consideration of these subjects received at the hands of the ancient physicians the greatest possible attention, is evidenced in all their writings. Not only were they in the habit of studying the constitution of the season in which any epidemic or pestilential malady was prevailing, but they</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>deemed it essential to take into calculation the peculiarity of the seasons of the previous year. This close and accurate observation of the meteorological conditions on which disease depends enabled them to predicate with almost unerring certainty, not only the advent but the very nature of an impending epidemy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Thus, Hippocrates writes, <i>&quot;</i>as the season and year advance he (the physician) can tell what epidemic diseases will attack the city, either in summer or winter,&quot; &quot;and must (consequently) succeed in the preservation of health, and be by no means unsuccessful in the practice of his art.&quot; In <i>Aphorism </i>xi. sect. iii. we read, &quot; If the <i>winter </i>be of a dry and <i>northerly </i>character, and the <i>spring rainy </i>and <i>southerly, </i>in <i>summer </i>there will necessarily be acute fevers, ophthalmies, and dysenteries.&quot; And in <i>Aph. </i>xiii. &quot;If the <i>summer </i>be <i>dry </i>and <i>northerly, </i>and the <i>autumn rainy </i>aud <i>southerly, </i>headaches occur in <i>winter, </i>with coughs, hoarsenesses, coryzae, and in some cases consumption.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>374. It may be observed, as a general rule, that all seasons are <i>unhealthy </i>which are <i>unseasonable. </i>Thus, cold and wet springs, cold and wet summers, warm and moist autumns, warm and wet winters, are, proverbially, fruitful sources of disease. The old saying, that &quot;a green winter makes a fat churchyard,&quot; has long received the general assent of all classes. Moser, however, has laid it down that &quot;elevation of temperature above the ordinary range diminishes the mortality of winter, and increases that of summer.&quot; The former is true only so far as it applies to the aged and the young, to both of whom severe winters are very fatal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>375. The ancient physicians were well aware of the unwholesome character of unseasonable weather; thus Hippocrates, <i>Aph. </i>viii. sect. iii. &quot;In seasons which are regular, and</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>furnish the productions of the season at the seasonable time, the diseases are regular, and come readily to a crisis; but, in inconstant seasons, the diseases are irregular, and come to a crisis with difficulty.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>376. It has been laid down as an aphorism by Arbuthnot, that every season has its special diseases, not as a matter of accident, but as the result of fixed physical or chemical laws. In winter, those of the respiratory system prevail; in spring, inflammatory affections of the chest, and febrile disorders; in summer and autumn, that class of disorders predominates of which one of the essential symptoms is exudation from the intestinal surface, and from the liver; and in autumn fevers.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>377. Of the seasons, the greatest mortality belongs to winter, the next to spring, then follows autumn, whilst summer affords the smallest number of deaths.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>378. It has been observed that certain epidemic disorders, like seasons, recur about every fourteen or fifteen years. In other words, that a particular disease which occurred during a season marked by some peculiarity recurred during a subsequent season marked by similar peculiarities. If this be found to be universally the case, it will go far to establish the influence of weather in the production of disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>379. Mr. Glaisher has shown that during a period of eightyfive years, in which the mean annual temperature at Greenwich has been recorded, &quot;periods of cold years came together, and periods of warm years came together;&quot; of the former, the maximum was gradually succeeded by that of the latter :-&#8212;</p>

The nights are calm and frosty, or darksome and disturbed by the howling of the south-west wind among the leafless trees; or a sharp north-east wind may blow throughout the day and night.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>382. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; says Washington Irving, &quot;the tempest howls with redoubled fury; at others the cold and sleety rain falls thick and fast; the hoar frost spreads its snowy mantle o&#39;er hedge and field; while the cloudless deep blue sky and the glowing east speak deceitfully of to-morrow&#39;s softness and beauty.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>383. Our rivers, lakes, and ponds bound in icy chains, the frost, the snow, the leafless tree, the dreariness and desolation of the landscape, bespeak the wisdom and design of the beneficent interposition of the Almighty hand in assigning to the earth this season of the year as its sabbatical rest, its period of refreshing slumber and fertilising repose&#8212;the promise and the harbinger of a bounteous and plentiful harvest.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>506. It has been shown that the winds which blow from W. to N. and from N. to E., indeed all those which blow from any point <i>north </i>of the equator, including the W. and E., are associated with our fair weather and our driest seasons; whilst those which blow from any point to the <i>south </i>of the equator, exclusive of the W. and E., but more especially from the S.E., are most intimately connected with our wet seasons, with floods and inundations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>507. Whilst the moon is far south of the equator there falls, in this climate, but a moderate quantity of rain; whilst she is crossing the equator towards these latitudes our rain increases, attains its maximum during the week in which she is in full north declination, or most nearly vertical to these latitudes, and during her return over the equator to the south the rain is redflced to its minimum quantity. This obtains in very nearly the same proportions both in an extremely dry and in an extremely wet season.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>508. The annual average amount of rain which falls in this country is according to Mr. Howard 24-804 inches; to Mr. Belville 24-78; and to Mr. Glaisher 24-605 inches.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>517. About <i>one </i>year in <i>five </i>is subject to the <i>dry extreme, </i>and <i>one </i>in <i>ten </i>to the <i>wet extreme. </i>The wet years are uniformly <i>cold, </i>the dry invariably <i>warm. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>The Winds. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>526. It has been already shown that winds are currents of air similar in kind to those of the ocean (117); that they tend to equalise the temperature of the surface of the globe (118); and to transport, by means of the clouds, the waters of seas and oceans into the interior of lands and continents, where water otherwise could never reach (189). Nor is the influence of the more violent movements of the atmosphere, storms and hurricanes, on the animal economy other than most salutary, by the free and perfect ventilation which they ensure, and by the dissipation and dilution of noxious gaseous emanations and exhalations, which they effect.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>But, irrespective of this their general purpose, they possess peculiar, distinctive, and inherent characters and properties, depending on the quarter of the compass whence they blow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>527. The dryness, humidity, pressure, and temperature of the atmosphere, constituting &quot;<i>the weather,&quot; </i>are intimately associated with and dependent upon the quarter whence the wind blows.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>528. The chances are greatly in favour of rain following wind, from what quarter soever it may blow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>529. If the wind proceed from latitudes warmer than our own, it will, upon reaching our colder regions, and commixing with our atmosphere, deposit in the form of rain all that amount of moisture which the mean temperature of the two cannot suspend in the form of vapour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>530. The same result sometimes attends upon winds from higher and colder latitudes mixing with our warmer atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>531. The <i>strength </i>of the wind has a great and marked influence on health. In bronchial irritation wind is peculiarly prejudicial.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>532. Captain Parry often supported a temperature of 0&#176; Fah. without suffering any inconvenience when the atmosphere was<span class='gtxt_body'>
calm, whilst a cold of 20&#176; Fah. was very annoying when accompanied by even a slight wind. In a <i>calm air, </i>the sensation produced by a temperature of &#8212; 55&#176; Fah. might be compared to that experienced at O<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span> Fah. <i>with a breeze. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Not the slightest inconvenience was suffered from exposure to the open air, at a temperature of &#8212; 55&#176; Fah. by a person well clothed, as long as the weather was perfectly calm; but in walking against a very light air of wind, a smarting sensation was experienced all over the face, accompanied by a pain in the middle of the forehead, which soon became rather severe.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>533. It therefore follows that a certain agitation of the air will produce a sensation of cold equivalent to the effect of a fall of 55o Fah.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>534. The wind blows least at sunrise and sunset; and most violently an hour or two after noon.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>535. The <i>north wind </i>(Septentrio, <i>&#39;Kirapicria^,) </i>is dry, cold, and heavy, and is generally accompanied with clear, dry, and serene weather.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>536. North winds prevail in the middle of winter, and are connected with our <i>driest </i>season about the vernal equinox. North to north-east winds predominate during March and April.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the barometer fall with this wind, the worst possible weather sets in; in winter, deep snows and severe frosts; and in summer, cold rains and violent storms.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>537. The northerly winds are deficient in <i>electric force. </i>Those which blow from N.N.W. to N. possess but 102 degrees of <i>electric force; </i>those from N.N.E. to N.E. 139 degrees.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>found that the above are the two &quot;<i>minima&quot; </i>of the whole; and that those which blow from W.N.W. to N.W., and from E.S.E. to S.E. are the two <i>&quot;maxima,&quot; </i>the former evidencing 272 degrees, and the latter 312 degrees.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>539. The annual average <i>number of days </i>during ten years, in which the prevailing wind in this country blew from west to north, not including the latter point, was ascertained by Mr. Luke Howard to be 100-4, the greatest number being 124, and the least 83.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>540. North winds, with a tendency to&quot; north-east, give rise, according to Mr. Hingeston, to cholera.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>541. Wet northerly winds disturb the digestive organs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>542. The <i>North-east </i>wind (Aquilo, <i>fiopeas, </i>Etesias), in the north-western parts of Europe, is cold, sharp, dry, and heavy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>543. M. Monge, in explaining the cause of the peculiar characters of this wind, observes, that currents of air from this quarter, in their passage over mountain districts, lose, from elevation and diminished atmospheric pressure, a portion of their aqueous vapour, acquire a consequent increased density, and sustain a loss of temperature; that, in their onward progress they rush down on the lower lands of Poland and of the north of Germany, where, from their being far below the point of saturation, they occasion an abundant evaporation of the water of the lower strata of the atmosphere, and that this, by carrying off caloric, contributes further to the production of the cold peculiar to this wind. The specific gravity of the atmosphere is hereby increased, and the mercurial column rises in the barometer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>544. This wind is our dry-weather wind, and has been shown by Mr. Howard to bear as close a relation to dry weather as does the south-east wind to rain.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>549. The <i>east wind </i>(Solanas, &#39;AwtfXMwrq?) is dry and cold. It partakes of all the properties of the north-east wind, and is intimately associated with our <i>driest </i>season about the vernal equinox.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>550. Easterly winds, having traversed the continents of Asia and Russia, contain but little aqueous vapour, and no ozone.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>551. If the barometer fall with an east direction, the wind will go round to the south, unless heavy snow or rain follow immediately.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>553. The annual average <i>number of days </i>during ten years, in which the prevailing wind in this country was from north to east, not including the latter point, was, according to Mr. Luke Howard, 74-4.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>554. East winds blow chiefly during the day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>555. Cynanche trachealis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia, are some of the diseases induced by this wind.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>559. The south-east wind is intimately connected with electrical indications, with hail and with thunder.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>560. The <i>quantity of electricity </i>contained in winds which blow from E.S.E. to S.E. is 312&#176;, one of the two <i>&quot;maxima&quot; </i>of <i>electric force. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>561. Cholera and influenza are especially associated with the prevalence of this wind.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>562. Bronchitis, cynanche parotidea, diarrhoea, and dysentery are among the diseases induced by this wind.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>563. This is one of the equatorial or ozoniferous winds which extend from S.E. to N.W. by way of the S. and W.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>564. The polar or non-ozoniferous winds are those which blow from any other point on the north side of the equator.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>565. Dr. Moffatt is of opinion that more <i>diseases </i>occur during a prevalence of ozone or equatorial winds, and more <i>deaths </i>during polar or non-ozoniferous winds. The latter circumstance he attributes to the reduction of temperature; the former to the excess of ozone.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>566. The <i>south wind </i>(Notus, the&#39;<i>-Apyeo-Trj*; </i><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Noto? </span>of Homer,) is always associated with humidity and an elevated temperature, though few winds are more cold and &quot;searching&quot; than is the wind from this quarter <i>before </i>the rain falls.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>567. Southerly winds are invariably accompanied with rain, in most parts of Europe at least, and probably in the greater portions of our hemisphere. Their rainy character is proverbial. They are intimately connected with the <i>wet </i>season following the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>570. Annual <i>average of days, </i>according to Mr. Luke Howard, on which the prevailing wind is from east to south, not including the latter point, is 53-9.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>571. Ancient writers attached a vast amount of odium to this wind, which Mr. Haviland thinks it justly merits. Galen says moist weather produces fluxes of the belly; Aristotle, that the south wind is moist and heavy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>572. The pressure of the atmosphere during a southerly direction undergoes great changes, as evidenced by the oscillations of the barometer, of which the lowest depressions occur with this and the south-west wind. A fall of the mercurial column, with a south wind, is invariably followed by rain, and in winter is attended with thunder. If the fall be considerable, severe but short gales arise; if sudden, violent storms succeed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>573. South winds are highly ozoniferous, and probably, on this account, produce catarrhs and bronchitis. They soothe and allay a dry and irritable condition of the mucous surfaces of the air tubes and cells, and greatly alleviate the sufferings, and indefinitely prolong the existence, of the phthisical patient.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>574. The <i>south-west wind </i>(Austro Africus, <i>AiffdvoTos, </i>stormy zephyr,) is warm and moist, and generally brings gales, and rain in abundance, especially towards the latter part of autumn and beginning of winter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>575. This wind, like the south and west wind, is associated with the wet season following the autumnal equinox, and is almost invariably accompanied, if not preceded, by a falling barometer.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>579. From the deduction of the gyratory law of winds by Dove, it appears that in our northern zone &quot;the elasticity of vapour is greatest with this wind.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>580. The south-west wind, charged with all the purity and freshness of the Atlantic breezes, and a large amount of ozone, is eminently conducive to health. From its increased moisture and elevated temperature it is exceedingly prone to aggravate chronic bronchitis, and is as singularly calculated to alleviate the sufferings and prolong the existence of the phthisical patient.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>581. The stormy character of this wind did not escape our immortal bard in the malediction which he makes Caliban heap upon Prospero and Miranda:&#8212;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>582. During the prevalence of south and south-west winds there is little variation of temperature between the day and night, in consequence of the sun&#39;s rays being prevented reaching the earth by the dense vapour with which the air is loaded.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>583. Southerly winds, from their elevated temperature, have a tendency to ascend acclivities, whilst north or mountain winds have an opposite inclination.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>584. The <i>west wind </i>(Favonius, <i>Ze&lt;j&gt;vpo&lt;;, </i>clear blowing zephyr of Homer), like the north-east wind, is associated with our fair weather.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>588. Westerly, or W.S.W. winds, in both temperate zones, are the prevailing counter-currents to the trades or east winds of the tropics. In this country the winds from these points blow for a greater number of days, without intermission, than from any other quarter, and are the principal cause of our mild winters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>589. If a sudden and considerable fall of the barometric column take place with a west wind, a violent storm from the north-west or north will follow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>590. In the United States storms <i>invariably </i>come from the west, and sometimes last two or three days.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>This wind is always accompanied by a thick haze or fog. It destroys all vegetable production, burns up the leaves of evergreen shrubs and trees, and blisters the hands and face of the human subject. Singularly enough it restores to health and life those labouring under fevers, arrests the spread of epidemics, the contagion of small-pox, and renders inoculation inert, and of none effect.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>601. Dr. Lind differs materially on this point. He considers the harmattan a &quot; malignant and fatal wind.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>602. The <i>simoom </i>blows during April and May over the deserts from all points of the compass. It is an excessively hot wind, &quot;similar to a blast from a furnace,&quot; or &quot;burning oven,&quot; surcharged with fine sand, rapidly alternating with cold pestilential puffs of a putrid and sulphureous smell.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>603. This wind, like the harmattan, withers the vegetation over which it blows, and in man produces instant suffocation, or at the least asthma, and leaves the sufferer for years in a state of extreme prostration and depression.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>604. The simoom, the approach of which is very rapid, is recognized by a red or purple haze in the horizon, the consequence of its extreme dryness (186), but which is supposed by the Egyptians to represent the red colour of the body of Typho, the spirit of drought and death.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>605. The simoom is the qadim, or <i>east wind </i>of the Old Testament. Its effects on animal and vegetable life are alluded to by Job xv. 2, &quot;Shall a wise man fill his belly with the east wind?&quot; and it is more particularly referred to in Hosea xiii. 15, &quot;though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall come, &amp;c.&quot; and in Ezek. xvii. 10, xix. 12, &quot;shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it?&quot; &quot;the east wind dried up her fruit.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>606. In Hebrew, as in Arabic, qadim, and shurqiyeh, the name by which the easterly winds of Palestine are called at the present day, are applied to the winds which have great affinity with each other, and blow from E.N.E., E., E.S.E. or S.E.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>607. The <i>sirocco </i>is a hot stifling wind peculiar to Italy and Dalmatia. It blows during the day about Easter from the S.S.E., and usually lasts twenty days.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Its effects are exceedingly enervating, and productive of great languor and lassitude.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>608. <i>Calms.</i>&#8212;In contradistinction to winds are calms. These are the effects merely of the absence of the aerial currents, and consist in a stagnant, gloomy, overcast, misty or hazy condition of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>609. Calms are unquestionably productive of the most baneful and pernicious consequences, by favouring the concentration of miasmata, and of animal and vegetable effluvia, particularly among a crowded and uncleanly population; and by delaying those changes in the atmosphere which are necessary to the renewal of its purity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>610. Calms contribute in the highest possible degree to the production, aggravation, and propagation of epidemic disease, and are associated with plagues and pestilence.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>611. We read in Maitland&#39;s &quot;History of London,&quot; that for several weeks before the plague made its appearance in London, in 1665, there had been an uninterrupted calm. Dr. Baynard, a cotemporary writer, confirms this fact. Diemerbroeck, in giving an account of the plague at Nimeguen, mentions a similar condition of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>612. During the most fatal periods of the three visitations of the pestilential cholera, this still and oppressive condition of the air was observed to prevail, not only in this country, but in every city, town, or locality throughout Europe where the disease appeared. From the 1st July to 31st October, a period</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of 123 days, a calm was noted on 65 days, more than one-half of the whole number. In July the greatest pressure of the wind on the surface of a square foot was 2 lbs. in one instance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>613. The disease proved most fatal in those localities where the atmosphere was the calmest.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>614. The <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Barometer.</span>&#8212;We have already stated, when speaking of the <i>barometer, </i>that a column of mercury 30 inches high, exactly counterpoises a column of air, of an equal base, extending from the sea-level to the top of the atmosphere (35). We have also stated that should the atmospheric pressure be diminished or increased by any disturbing causes, by rarefied or by denser atmosphere, the mercury in the tube will either fall or rise in a corresponding degree (36).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>615. The application of the barometer in measuring heights of mountains and other elevated localities, has been already</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>- exemplified (37 to 48). We have now to treat of the barometer in connection with the <i>weather. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>616. The fall and rise of the barometer depend on, and bear a due relation to the variations in the density of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>617. These variations are caused by unequal distribution of heat, and consequent production of winds (117), both of which are intimately concerned in the precipitation of rain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>618. The <i>mean annual height </i>of the barometer in this country, according to Mr. Howard, is 29<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>823 inches; to Mr. Belville, 29-872 inches; and to Mr. Gusher, 29-772 inches.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>619. On the 5th Feb. 1821, wind N.W., mean temp. 31&#176; -50, new moon on 2nd, the barometer rose to 30-80 inches; and on the 24th December of the same year, wind S., mean temp. 43&#176;, new moon, it fell to 27<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>80, a depression and range in London nearly without a precedent on record. On the following day, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the reading of the barometer was 27-89 inches only. In 1778, Sir George Shuckburgh observed the barometer in London at 30-935 inches, the highest reading ever seen.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>620. The <i>maximum </i>height of the barometer takes place during the first three months, and the <i>minimum </i>height during the last three months of the year. The former is connected with northerly and the Litter with southerly winds.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>622. The barometer falls before rain or wind, and rises during or subsequently to it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>623. The fall which precedes wind, and the oscillations of <span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> the mercurial column which accompany violent storms and hurricanes, depend on very great rarefaction of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>624. Warm dry air weighs heavier than cold and damp air. The former elevates, the latter depresses, the barometric column. The denser the atmosphere, the higher is the mercury; the more rarefied the air, the lower the barometer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>625. The <i>range </i>of the barometer, which within the tropics is comparatively small, <i>increases loith the latitude, </i>on account of the diminution of temperature, and consequent increase of density of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>626. The <i>greatest daily mean pressure </i>for the year occurs about the 9th of January, and the <i>minimum daily mean depression </i>towards the end of November.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>627. The <i>greatest monthly mean pressure </i>occurs in June, and the <i>lowest </i>in November. A <i>second maximum </i>occurs in January, and a <i>second minimum </i>in March.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>628. Mr. Howard has ascertained that the barometer in London, on a mean of ten years, suffers in moderate and<span class='gtxt_body'>
settled weather a <i>depression </i>of about one-tenth of an inch at new and full moon, the consequence of the greater influence of these phases, in comparison with the first and third quarters, in the production of regular lunar atmospheric tides, on which the fall depends.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>629. The influence of the moon on the temperature and density of our atmosphere appears to be exercised chiefly through the medium of the winds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>630. A tolerably constant relation obtains <i>between </i>the <i>movements </i>of the <i>barometer </i>and the <i>variations </i>of the <i>temperature </i>of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>631. In the early cold periods of the year, and in the fine weather of summer, <i>opposition </i>in movements predominates; but in the decline of the year, when the atmosphere is losing both heat and water, and when the season is tending to rain, the movements are in the <i>same direction. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>632. Two degrees of Fahrenheit are equivalent in these variations to a tenth of an inch of the barometric column.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>633. <i>Every inch </i>which the barometer rises or falls either elevates or depresses the <i>boiling-point </i>of water by about 1-76&#176;. M. de Saussure found water boil at the top of Mont Blanc at 187-099&#176; Pah.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>634. Periods of epidemic and pestilential diseases are associated with an unusually high state of the barometric column.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>635. During the height of the three epidemic visitations of cholera, in 1832, 1849, and 1854, the pressure of the atmosphere was remarkably and continuously high.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On the 18th February, 1832, the reading of the barometer was 30-60 inches. On the 11th February, 1849, it reached to 30-91 inches: &quot;A reading not likely,&quot; says Mr. Glaisher, &quot;to occur but once in 30 years.&quot; During the third outbreak of the disease, in 1854, the reading was as high as 30-50 inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>636. The exceeding density of the atmosphere indicated by this extreme height of the barometer would retard, if not prevent, vaporous diffusion; and, as a consequence, would materially aggravate the stagnation of miasmatic exhalation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>637. The mean weight of a cubic foot of air for the year was found to be two grains above the average.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>638. The decline of the disease appeared in some measure to be connected with decreased reading of the barometer; as this occurred, the number, virulence, and mortality of the attacks lessened.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>639. The minimum reading of the barometer was 29&#39;25 inches. This was accompanied by a violent storm of wind, of which the horizontal pressure amounted to 20 lbs. on the square inch.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>640.

<p class='gtxt_body'>641. Dr. Halley, John Patrick, M.

<p class='gtxt_body'>642. In applying these rules, it should be borne in mind that the changes in the atmosphere indicated by the barometer may occur in the upper part only, and may not extend to and be observable at the surface of the earth; and that variations in the weight of the atmosphere over any given district may arise, not from changes of wind or weather in that district, but from changes in the atmosphere of an adjoining district.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>(1.) Indications of approaching changes of weather, and especially of the direction and force of winds, depend less on the absolute height of the mercury in the tube, than on its falling and rising.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(2.) A height of 30 inches at the level of the sea is more indicative of settled weather and steady winds than any other height.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(3.) The barometer is said to be <i>falling </i>when the mercury in the tube is sinking, at which time its upper surface is almost always concave or hollow; the barometer is said to be <i>rising, </i>when the mercurial column is lengthening, and its upper surface is convex or rounded.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(4.) The <i>rising </i>of the mercury presages in general fair, and its falling foul, weather, as rain, snow, high winds, and storms.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(5.) Below 30 inches the probability of rain is in an increased proportion with equal decrements of the mercurial column; above 30 inches the probabilities of fine weather are in a diminishing proportion with equal increments.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(6.) In calm weather, when the air is inclined to rain, the mercury is commonly low.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(7.) It sinks <i>lowest </i>in very great winds, though these be unattended with rain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(8.) In very hot weather the falling of the mercury forbodes thunder.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(9.) In winter the rising presages frost; and in frosty weather, if the mercury, which is generally high, fall three or four tenths of an inch, a <i>thaw </i>will <i>certainly </i>follow; but in a <i>continued frost, </i>if the mercury rise, it will <i>certainly snow. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(10.) A rapid rise of the barometer indicates the approach of unsettled weather; a slow rise, the reverse.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(11.) A considerable and rapid fall is a sign of stormy weather, though of short duration, and is usually accompanied with rain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(12.) A sudden rise in the barometer during a storm indicates that the worst is over.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>(13.) The greatest depressions of the barometer are accompanied by rain and gales from the south and south-west; the greatest elevations by north-west, north, and north-east winds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(14.) Although the barometer almost always falls with a southerly and rises with a northerly wind, the reverse sometimes occurs, iu which case the southerly wind will be dry, and the weather fine, whilst the northerly wind will be wet and violent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(15.) When the barometer sinks considerably, high winds, rain, or snow will follow: the wind will be from the northward, if the thermometer is low for the season; from the southward, if the thermometer is high.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(16.) If, when the wind is from any point between northwest and north-east, the barometer fall and the thermometer rise, the wind will shift to the south.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(17.) If, when the wind is from any point between east and south-west, the barometer fall, an increasing gale from that quarter will ensue, which will be of shorter or longer duration according as the fall is rapid or slow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(18). Sudden falls of the barometer, with the wind from west, are frequently followed by violent storms from northwest or north, during which the mercury will rise to its former height.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>(19.) If a gale set in from the east or south-east, and the wind veer by the south, the barometer will continue falling until the wind becomes south-west, when a comparative lull may occur j after which the gale will be renewed, and the &quot;veering of the wind towards the north-west will be indicated by a rise of the barometer and a fall of the thermometer. These gales, which are accompanied by unusually high tides and the heaviest seas, are supposed to have a rotatory movement (101,102,103,104). When a lull in the course of the storm occurs, it is a sign that the centre of the revolving gale is passing over or near the place of observation.</p>

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Before </span>entering upon the further consideration of our subject, it is desirable we should take a brief survey of <i>respiration </i>and its phenomena, both in the vegetable and animal kingdom.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>644. Respiration is common to <i>plants </i>and <i>animals. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>645. Respiration is the act of receiving a portion of atmospheric air, or water impregnated with air, into the lungs or respiratory apparatus, by <i>inspiration, </i>whence, after a brief interval of time, it is expelled in the act of <i>expiration. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>646. Respiration is effected by the contact of atmospheric air, or of aerated water, with the circulating fluids in their passage through the innumerable capillaries ramifying on the delicate membranes constituting a respiratory surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>647. In <i>plants </i>this function is performed by the <i>leaves. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>648. The <i>products </i>of respiration in the animal and vegetable kingdoms are essentially different.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>649. <i>Animals rob </i>the air of its <i>oxygen, </i>and <i>exhale </i>into it <i>carbonic acid gas. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>650. <i>Plants absorb </i>from the atmosphere, and decompose, <i>carbonic acid, </i>fix its carbon, and <i>restore </i>the <i>oxygen </i>to the air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>651. This is more particularly the case during the <i>day, </i>and especially during <i>sunshine. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>652. During the <i>night, </i>and in the <i>shade, </i>the leaves of plants <i>absorb oxygen, </i>and <i>give off carbonic acid. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>653. Professor Burnet has referred these phenomena to <i>respiration </i>and <i>digestion. </i>The former is supposed to be with<span class='gtxt_body'>out intermission, and to be attended by the formation and <i>exhalation </i>of <i>carbonic acid gas; </i>the latter to take place only during their exposure to light, and to consist in the <i>decomposition </i>of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, the <i>absorption </i>of the <i>carbon, </i>and <i>exhalation </i>of the <i>oxygen. </i></span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>654. The fungi and the fig-tree offer exceptions to the general rule. Marcet found that mushrooms converted the oxygen of the air into carbonic acid both during the <i>day and night. </i>According to Pepys, the perfectly healthy leaves of the fig-tree evolve oxygen even during the <i>absence of light. </i>The Jerusalem artichoke derives its nitrogen <i>immediately from the atmosphere. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>655. The leaves of plants also withdraw water from the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>656. The decomposition of carbonic acid by plants is proportionate to the intensity and duration of the light to which they are exposed. The quantity absorbed is directly as the force of vegetation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>657. Oxygen is not evolved by plants except carbonic acid be present in the air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>658. Aquatic plants decompose the carbonic acid of the air in the water, and give off oxygen during the influence of light. Part of the carbonic acid contained in the waters of the ocean, lakes, and lTvers, is doubtless derived from the respiration of fishes, and would accumulate to a noxious extent were it not replaced by the oxygen emitted by the plants. Hence, fish never thrive in waters which are exempt from vegetation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>659. Plants, then, are as indispensably necessary to the existence of animals as are animals to the existence of plants, for these inhale that which animals exhale, and exhale that which animals inhale.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>incessantly <i>consume, </i>viz. carbonic acid, water, nitrogen, and oxide of ammonium. What the one gives to the atmosphere the other takes from it. Hence, it has been tritely said that, &quot;in so far as their actual organic elements are concerned, plants and animals are the offsprings of the air.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>661. By the reciprocal action, therefore, of plants and animals, the <i>composition of the atmosphere </i>is preserved <i>nearly absolutely unchanged. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>662. Such, however, is the enormous bulk of the atmosphere that, even if there were no restorative or renovating agencies in operation, no less a period than 800,000 years must elapse before the animals living on the surface of the earth could consume the whole of its oxygen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>663. The total weight of the oxygen of the atmosphere has been stated (310) to be equal to 134,000 cubes of copper, one kilometre in the side. Now, supposing the earth to be peopled by 1,000,000,000 men, and its animals to be equivalent to 3,000,000,000 more men, and plants to have ceased from their functions over the entire surface of the earth, it may be shewn that these together would not consume, in the course of a year, a weight of oxygen equal to 16 of these 134,000 cubical kilometres of copper; or, that the oxygen of the atmosphere would not be diminished to any greater extent than ^^th P<span class="gstxt_sup">art</span> &#176;^ its entire weight, during a century; and, further, that no sensible effect would be produced on Volta&#39;s eudiometer in a less period than 10,000 years.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>664. But were the vegetable kingdom to cease for only one single year to prepare <i>food </i>for man and animals, the whole earth would be depopulated; animals would perish of hunger, and organic life would disappear with vegetation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>665. The vegetable world is an immense storehouse of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, destined for the consumption of the animal world.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>666. The atmosphere is the mysterious link which connects the animal with the vegetable, the vegetable with the animal kingdom; in fine, the <i>atmosphere </i>is the source whence the vegetable world is nourished. Vegetables and animals, therefore, come from the atmosphere, and return to it again.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>667. In <i>animals </i>the process of respiration is partly <i>mechanical, </i>and partly <i>chemical. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>668. By the function of respiration the fluids of the living body are oxygenated and decarbonized, and their vital properties renovated.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>669. Respiration takes place in the general surface of the skin, or in the mucous lining of the alimentary canal, or in any external or internal organ especially appropriated to it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>670. The <i>lowest animals </i>respire by their general cutaneous mucous surface only.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>671. In the <i>more perfect </i>animals, the external surface is not sufficient for the aeration of the circulating fluids, and hence the necessity for an apparatus which, in a small space, affords the largest possible superficies for contact with the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>672. The external skin, or its internal mucous prolongation, is the origin of most of the forms of respiratory organs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>673. A respiratory organ is a determinate portion of external membrane destined to effect certain chemical changes in the air, or in water impregnated with air, which comes in contact with it, developed, by multicapsular foldings, within a small space, into a great extent of surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>a. </i>The respiring surface may be obtained by the development of a system of tracheal tubes, ramified to extreme fineness, and spread through the most minute portions of all the organs of the body&#8212;the tracheal system of <i>insects. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>b. </i>The respiratory organs may be situated towards the exterior of the body, in the form of lamellated, ramified, pectinated, tufted, ciliated, or pinnated processes, called <i>branchice, </i>or gills&#8212;the respiratory system of <i>fishes. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>c. </i>Or, the respiratory organs may be situated towards the interior of the body in the form of ramified tubes, or sacculated cavities, called lungs&#8212;the respiratory system of <i>reptiles, birds, </i>and <i>mammalia. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>674. The respiratory organs of the <i>infusoria </i>consist of delicate <i>cilia. </i>In the <i>polypi/era </i>the whole surface serves the function of respiration. The tintacula of the <i>alcyonella </i>supply the office of branchiae. In the <i>holothuria </i>the respiratory apparatus assumes the form of an arborescent tube, with terminal cellules, the water entering the general cavity of the peritoneum through the cloacal aperture. The upper surface of the body of the <i>asterias </i>is covered with innumerable minute transparent colourless fleshy tubes, through which water has access into the interior cavity of the body. The <i>annelida </i>possess tufted branchiae of an arborescent form, and, sometimes, membranous sacculi, or internal air-cells. Of the <i>mollusca, </i>some breathe in water by means of branchiae; others in the air, by means of lungs. The organs of respiration of the <i>Crustacea </i>are branchiae, attached either to the feet or to the abdominal surface of the body. In the terrestrial <i>onisci, </i>which respire air, the branchiae are simple hollow leaf-like appendages.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>675. The respiration of the <i>arachnida </i>is both pulmonary and tracheary. The first consists of sacculated cavities on the under surface of the abdomen, opening by means of stigmata; the second of tracheal tubes, ramifying through all parts of the body. <i>All insects </i>have a system of ramifying tracheae; for the most part, the respiration is aerial. In the <i>orihoptera </i>there are distinct respiratory movements, alternate dilatation and con</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>traction of the abdomen. <i>Fishes </i>breathe by branchiae, the surface of which offers the greatest possible extent for the contact of aerated water. In the common ray, the branchiae or gills have a surface of 2,250 square inches. The <i>amphibia </i>respire, while young, by means of branchiae, to which, in many, pulmonic cavities are subsequently superadded. The lungs of <i>reptiles </i>are capacious sacs, subdivided into numerous polygonal cells by internal membranous septa. The lungs of <i>hirds </i>are spongy masses of extreme vascularity, firmly bound down to the dorsal aspect of the thorax; the main trunks of the bronchial tubes perforate the pulmonary organs, and open by wide mouths into large and numerous thoracico-abdominal cells, which communicate freely with the cavities of the bones.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the <i>mammalia </i>the structure of the lungs is of a higher order.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>676. The respiratory organs of <i>man </i>consist of a <i>trachea (rpaxeia aprrjpia), </i>or windpipe, and two spongy and highly vascular organs, <i>lungs </i>(pulmones), occupying the greater part of the cavity of the thorax.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>677. The lungs are situated in the lateral parts of the thorax, separated from each other by the mediastina, heart, and large blood vessels, but connected to each other by the bronchi and pulmonary vessels.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>678. The lungs have the form of an irregular cone. The base, which is broad and concave, rests upon the convex surface of the diaphragm. The apex, which is rounded, reaches to the level of the first rib; and, in those whose chests are narrow, sometimes extends a little higher. Their inner or mesial surfaces, which are in contact with the pericardium, are much flattened, or even concave.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>679. The right lung is divided into three lobes; the left into two.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>680. The <i>volume </i>of the lungs always bears a due relation to the capacity of the cavity of the chest. Ever in contact<span class='gtxt_body'>
with the internal surface of its walls, the lungs follow all its movements, dilate and contract with it, and adapt themselves accurately to all its varying dimensions.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>681. The trachea, opposite to the third dorsal vertebra, bifurcates into two smaller tubes, the right and left bronchus, one for each lung, which they enter at the root. The bronchi divide and subdivide into a vast series of minute branches and delicate extremities, resembling in each lung an inverted, hollow, leafless tree. Each more minute and remote ramification forming a <i>lobular bronchial tube, </i>enters a distinct <i>&#8226;pulmonary lobule, </i>within which it undergoes still further division, and ultimately terminates in a small distinct polyhedral <i>cell, </i>or <i>air-vesicle, </i>of which it is said there are six hundred millions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>682. The entire extent of the interior surface of the airtubes and pulmonary cells has been estimated, by Keil and Hales, at upwards of 21,000 square inches; and by Lieberkuhn, at 1,400 square feet, or 201,600 square inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>683. The internal surface of the trachea and bronchia is lined by a mucous membrane, and is provided with a ciliated epithelium: that of the terminal bronchial tubes and air-cells consists of an exceedingly fine, delicate, and transparent membrane, covered by a stratum of squamous epithelium, which, in the latter, by a doubling inwards of itself, forms the intervening septa.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>684. Lymphatics, nerves, and a small artery, with its accompanying vein, are distributed to each air-cell, forming around it a delicate and dense capillary net-work, which is spread beneath the thin transparent mucous membrane of both the terminal and lateral air-cells.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>685. The meshes of the net-work are scarcely larger than the vessels themselves, the smallest of which only measures from a/jiy to joV^ inch. The coats of the capillaries are excessively</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>thin, and thus more readily admit of the free exhalation and absorption of which the pulmonary cells are the seat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>686. The structure of the lungs, therefore, is <i>bronchial, lobulated, vascular, nervous, lymphatic, </i>and <i>areolar. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>687. The <i>bronchial </i>portion consists of the ramifications of the bronchia: the <i>lobulated, </i>of innumerable air-cells, invested by areolar tissue, and opening into the finest terminations of the <i>lobular bronchial tubes: </i>the <i>vascular, </i>of the pulmonary and bronchial arteries and veins; of these, the pulmonary <i>arteries </i>convey the <i>carbonized </i>blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the diaphanous walls of the air-cells for aeration, whence the <i>oxygenized </i>blood is returned by the pulmonary <i>veins </i>to the left auricle of the heart; the bronchial arteries carry blood for the nutrition of the lungs, which is returned by the bronchia] veins to the vena azygos; the mucous secretion found in the air-tubes and pulmonary cells is probably derived from the bronchial arteries distributed to their surface : the <i>nervous, </i>of branches from the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses, which are chiefly formed by branches from the pneumo-gastric and great intercostal nerves: the <i>lymphatic, </i>of superficial and deep-seated absorbents, and bronchial glands: and the <i>areolar, </i>of the interlobular areolar tissue which connects the whole together.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>688. The lungs are the least dense organs of the animal organism, and, according to Dr. Reid and Mr. Hutchinson, weigh, in the male, upon an average, only one thirty-seventh, and, in the female, only one forty-third part of the whole body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>689. The <i>chemical changes </i>effected in the blood by respiration are under the control of the grey filaments of the great sympathetic nerves and their ganglia.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>690. <i>Respiration, mechanism of.</i>&#8212;Though all the respiratory movements are performed involuntarily, they are, nevertheless, to a certain extent, subject to our own will. We can regulate the commencement of each inspiration, and can shorten or<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>691. <i>Inspiration.</i>&#8212;During <i>inspiration </i>the whole thoracic cavity and air-passages <i>dilate, </i>the diaphragm <i>contracts </i>and becomes more plane, the abdominal muscles relax, and the viscera are pressed down from above, and air rushes into the air-tubes and cells, distending them in proportion to the dilatation of the thorax.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>692. In a natural tranquil inspiration the dilatation of the chest is effected almost wholly by the contraction of the diaphragm, and descent of the abdominal viscera, and but slightly by the ribs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>693. In a <i>deep inspiration, </i>the ribs elevate and <i>advance </i>the <i>sternum, </i>whilst the <i>abdomen recedes. </i>The descent of the diaphragm is very questionable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>694. The lateral dilatation of the thorax is performed principally by the contraction of the external intercostal, scaleni, levatores costarum, serratus posticus superior, and thoracic muscles generally.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>695. <i>Expiration, </i>when perfectly natural, is the result of the mere collapse or elastic reaction of the parts recovering their natural state after the dilatations which they undergo in respiration.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>696. In <i>expiration, </i>the thorax, air-passages, and cells <i>contract, </i>the diaphragm <i>relaxes, </i>and becomes convex superiorly, and the air is expelled by the air-passages.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>697. <i>Extreme expiration </i>appears to consist in a general compression, approximation, and lowering of the ribs, and a receding or flattening of the whole anterior part of the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>698. It is believed that the lungs themselves do not aid in the respiratory movements.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>699. The breathing of the female is more costal and less abdominal than that of the male.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>700. The <i>muscles of expiration </i>are the recti, obliqui, and transversales abdominis, which draw down the ribs, and force the abdominal viscera against the relaxed diaphragm, and thus diminish the cavity of the thorax; and the serratus posticus inferior, sacro lumbalis, and longissimus dorsi.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>701. The <i>nerves of respiration </i>are, 1st, the portio dura of the seventh pair, the respiratory facial nerve of Sir Charles Bell; 2ndly, the superior and inferior, or recurrent, laryngeal, branches of the nervus vagus; 3rdly, spinal nerves, the nervus respiratorius externus of Bell, and the nervus ascessorius of Willis; 4th, the phrenic; 5th, the spinal nerves. &#187;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The 1st. governs the motions of the alae nasi and the muscles of the face; the 2nd. the dilatation and contraction of the glottis; the 3rd. the lateral dilatation of the thorax, the elevation of the shoulder, and contraction of the abdominal muscles; the 4th. the contraction of the diaphragm; and the 5th. the contraction of the abdominal muscles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>702. The medulla oblongata is the source of all the nervous influence of the respiratory movements. Its injury or destruction utterly annihilates them. Hence the medulla oblongata is the most mortal part of the body.</p>

The diaphragm takes no part in sneezing. <i>Yawning </i>consists of a deep and slow inspiration and expiration, with simultaneous action of the respiratory muscles of the face. <i>Hiccough </i>is really an affection of the diaphragm, an abrupt inspiration performed by the diaphragm alone, sometimes occurring whilst the glottis is closed. <i>Laughing </i>and <i>crying </i>are also accompanied with affections of the respiratory nerves of the face and trunk.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>706. The quantity of air which passes through the lungs during <i>ordinary </i>respiration, &quot; <i>breathing air,&quot; </i>is variously estimated, by different writers, at from 3 to 100 cubic inches. According to Matteucci 20 cubic inches, or rather more than half a pint, are taken into the lungs at each inspiration. Richerand fixes the quantity at 30 cubic inches; Haller, Thomson, and Menzies at 40 cubic inches. From 16 to 20 inches niay, however, be considered a nearer approximation to the truth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>707. The lungs cannot be completely emptied of air by the most violent muscular effort. That portion which remains in the lungs after the strongest expiration, and over which we have <i>not any control, </i>is termed <i>&quot;residual air,&quot; </i>and is calculated at from 40 to 260 cubic inches.

<p class='gtxt_body'>709. To that portion of air which can, by the deepest possible inspiration, be taken into the lungs, the term &quot;<i>complemental air&quot; </i>has been given. Davy estimates this at 119 cubic inches; Kite at 200; it may therefore be stated to be from 119 to 200 cubic inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>710. The term <i>vital capacity </i>of the chest, has been applied to the greatest voluntary expiration following the deepest inspiration, and is expressive of the &quot;<i>complemental,&quot; </i>&quot; <i>breathing&quot; </i>and <i>&quot;reserve airs&quot; conjointly. </i>This has been calculated at from 100 to 300 cubic inches.

<p class='gtxt_body'>711. The term &quot; <i>absolute capacity&quot; </i>is <i>something more </i>than &quot;<i>vital capacity,&quot; </i>and includes the &quot;<i>residual air.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>712. If to the &quot;<i>vital capacity,&quot; </i>225 cubic inches, be added the average <i>&quot;residual air,&quot; </i>150 cubic inches, the average <i>&quot;absolute capacity&quot; </i>of an adult male of ordinary height will be 375 cubic inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>713. The <i>&quot;vital capacity&quot; </i>may be considered as a constant quantity, but modified or disturbed by <i>stature, weight, age, </i>and <i>disease. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>714. <i>Stature bears </i>the most constant and marked relation to the vital capacity. The height being given, the vital capacity may be predicated almost unerringly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>715. The vital capacity increases with the height, in arithmetical progression, from 5 ft. to 6 ft.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>716. Below, and up to 5 ft. the mean vital capacity is 174 cubic inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>717. For <i>every inch </i>of height from 5 ft. to 6 ft. and upwards, the vital capacity is increased <i>eight </i>cubic inches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>718. The &quot;vital capacity,&quot; though corresponding so accu~ rately with the stature, is neither regulated by the size nor depth, the breadth nor length of the chest.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>719. The depth of the chest does not increase with the height.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>720. Height governs the amount of air expelled from the chest.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>721. The vital capacity is governed by the <i>mobility, </i>or range of movement of the boundaries of the thorax.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>722. The <i>mobility </i>of an ordinary man&#39;s chest is about <i>three </i>inches. It may be found by passing a tape measure round the chest over the region of the nipples, and directing the individual to inspire deeply, and expire forcibly. The difference between the two measurements will be the <i>&quot;mobility.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>723. The expiratory power is, on an average, one-third stronger than the inspiratory power.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>724. The inspiratory power is greatest at 5 ft. 7 in. and 5 ft. 8 in. As the stature <i>increases </i>beyond this the power gradually <i>decreases. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>725. The inspiratory power is a surer test of the <i>vis vitce </i>than the expiratory.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>726. The difference between the inspiratory and expiratory powers is chiefly due to the elasticity of the ribs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>727. The voluntary and elastic powers are <i>combined </i>in expiration, but <i>antagonise each other </i>in <i>inspiration. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>728. <i>Weight.</i>&#8212;The weight increases with, and may be calculated from, the height.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>729. At 5 ft. linch, or 61 inches of stature, the weight is 120 lbs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ft. In. ft. in. lbs. For <i>every inch </i>of stature from 5 1 to 5 4 the weight increases 6-2 5 4 &#8222; 5 7 &#8222; 3-3</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>5 7 &#8222; 6 0 &#8222; 65</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>730. At 5 feet 6 inches the vital capacity <i>decreases </i>1 cubic inch per lb. between 11J and 14 stone. At other heights a man must exceed his average weight by 7 per cent, before his vital capacity will be affected. <i>Beyond-this </i>it will be <i>diminished </i>one cubic inch per pound for the next 35 pounds.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>731. <i>Age.</i>&#8212;Up to 35 years the vital capacity <i>increases </i>with the age; from 35 to 65 years it <i>decreases </i>T43 cubic inch per year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>732. <i>Disease.</i>&#8212;In <i>phthisis pulmonalis </i>the vital capacity diminishes from 10 <i>(the early stage), </i>to 70 per cent, <i>(the advanced stage). </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>733. The vital capacity of the lungs is measured by the <i>spirometer </i>(from <i>a-nalpm, </i>to breathe, and <i>fierpov, </i>a <i>measure)</i>, the invention of Mr. Hutchinson.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This ingenious yet simple instrument is fully described in Mr. Hutchinson&#39;s able and interesting paper, which will amply repay an attentive perusal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>734. We must now pass on to the consideration of the <i>circulation of the blood, </i>and first of the <i>heart, </i>the centre of the circulating system.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>735. The <i>heart </i>is a hollow muscle, of an irregular pyramidal shape, placed between the concave surfaces of the two lungs, and enclosed in its proper investing membrane, <i>(hepericardium. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>736. The heart is a double organ, consisting, on either half, of an <i>auricle </i>placed superiorly, and of a <i>ventricle </i>placed inferiorly, communicating with each other by the auriculoventricular opening, both of which are furnished with a valve, called, on the left side the <i>mitral </i>or <i>bicuspid valve, </i>and on the right side the <i>tricuspid valve. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>737. The outlets of both the left and right ventricles are also furnished with valves, termed <i>sigmoid, </i>or <i>semilunar. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>738. The valves permit the blood to flow in the direction of the circulation, but prevent its regurgitation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>739. The <i>left </i>side of the heart is appropriated to the <i>sys-<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> temic, </i>the greater, or <i>arterial </i>circulation; the <i>right, </i>to the <i>pulmonary, </i>the lesser, or <i>venous. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>740. The blood is propelled, by a vermicular contraction of the left ventricle, through the arteries to the most remote capillaries of the body, nourishing in its course, and sustaining the vital activity of, all the organs and tissues. It returns by<span class='gtxt_body'>
the veins to the anterior or right auricle, by a peristaltic contraction of which it is driven into the right ventricle, and by this into the pulmonary artery, by the numerous branches of which it is distributed through the minute capillaries of the air-cells (687) to be exposed to atmospheric influence. Upon emerging from the lungs it enters the left or posterior auricle by the four pulmonary veins: by the contraction of this, simultaneously with the right auricle, it is forced into the left ventricle, whence, by the contraction of this synchronously with that of the right side of the heart, it is again propelled into the aorta, to be redistributed throughout the whole arterial system.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>741. Hering has calculated that the whole course of the circulation, with some few exceptions, is effected in from 25 to 30 seconds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>742. Reckoning the whole amount of blood (829) in the body at 32 pounds, and, assuming that at each systole the left ventricle projects 1&#163; ounce of blood, and that the number of the heart&#39;s contractions be 74 in the minute, it would require 314 pulsations, or 4 minutes 36&#163; seconds, to circulate the whole quantity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>743. The circulating system is the channel of communication between the capillaries of the lungs, wherein the blood is prepared by the action of the air for the maintenance of the different functions of life, and the capillaries of the rest of the body, where it is applied to the support of these different functions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>744. The contraction of the heart is called <i>systole </i>(from owreMiu, &quot;to contract&quot;); its dilatation, <i>diastole </i>(from <i>SiaareWw, &quot; </i>to separate &quot;).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>745. &quot;The natural sounds of the heart,&quot; which are too, &quot;are nearly similar to each other: the first occurs with the beat <i>(systole) </i>of the heart, the second immediately after. They</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>are caused <i>by the valves, </i>which, being membranous, are thrown each time they resist the reflux of the blood into a state of sudden tension, which produces sound.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>746. &quot;The <i>first </i>sound is caused by the tension produced in the shutting of the auriculo-ventricular valves, the <i>second </i>by that produced in the shutting of the ventriculo-arterial valves.&quot; &quot;No part of the sound depends upon muscular noise, <i>bruit musculaire.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>747. &quot;Any flexible solid suddenly brought from a state of relaxation to a state of tension vibrates, and its vibrations are sonorous or not&#8212;<i>i. e. </i>audible or not&#8212;according to its physical structure. At the commencement of the systole of the ventricles their auricular valves are flapped into play; at the instant of their closure the whole substance of the ventricles and the valves are suddenly brought into a state of tension, and then consequently vibrate.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>748. Much discussion has taken place, and no small amount of theories and hypotheses been broached, on the subject of the &quot;sounds of the heart.&quot; Dr. Walshc tells us that, from the time of Laennec, at least <i>twenty-nine </i>theories have been advanced in explanation. By some the sounds are attributed to a <i>&quot;bruit musculaire,&quot; </i>though <i>in health there is no such sound. </i>Others believe the sounds to be caused by &quot;the motion and collision between the particles of the contained fluids.&quot; Dr. O. B. Bellingham considers &quot;the sound to depend on the friction between the blood and the parietes of the arterial orifices;&quot; some, amongst whom Majendie, believe that the sounds are easily explained by &quot;impulsion of solids against solids &quot;&#8212;the stroke of the heart&#39;s apex against the ribs. It has been shown by Mr. E. L. Bryan that the <i>apex </i>of the heart <i>never touches </i>the chest-wall, and that the <i>side </i>of the</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The plain, simple, and self-convincing explanation of Dr. Billing recommends itself to one&#39;s common sense, and is unquestionably the <i>true cause </i>of the &quot;sounds of the heart.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>749. Dr. Halford, from an extended series of experiments on anesthajsied donkeys, dogs, and rabbits, has determined and settled this question beyond the possibility of further dispute or discussion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>750. In these experiments the anterior portion of the thorax was removed in order to expose the heart. The two sounds were now distinctly heard. The vena cava inferior was next compressed, just before it enters the heart, by a pair of Liston&#39;s bull-dog forceps; the superior cava and pulmonary veins, entering the right auricle, being at the same time compressed between the fingers and thumbs. The action of the heart continued as vigorous as before, although it contained little or no blood after the first contraction. A stethoscope was now applied, but wo <i>sound ichatever toas heard; </i>muscular action was going on, but sound was annihilated. Upon the fingers and forceps being removed, and blood admitted to the cavities of the heart, both sounds were restored.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>These sounds were destroyed and reproduced at pleasure; and in one or two instances the same heart contracted vigorously for upwards of an hour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>751. &quot;I contend, therefore,&quot; continues Dr. Halford, &quot; that the fact of both sounds being destroyed and reproduced by the same means is the greatest proof, <i>and the first that has ever been given, </i>that they depend upon the same cause, which is simply the backward current of the blood producing forcible closure and <i>tension, </i>first of the auriculo-ventricular (first</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>752. Sounds very similar to the first and second sounds of the heart were produced by Mr. Brakyn, of Dublin, on the heart of a dead ox, by means of air by which the several valves were closed. The tension thus occasioned emitted sounds very closely allied to those effected in the living animal by the impulse of the blood itself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>753. The action of the heart, in point of time, may be thus divided:&#8212;Last part or pause ^, first sound and impulse J, second sound J, first part or pause ^.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>754. The movements of the heart are regulated by the pericardium.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>755. The contractions of the heart of an adult man in the middle period of life vary from seventy to seventy-four or five.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The frequency of the pulse is somewhat diminished during sleep.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>758. The pulse may be reduced 50 beats in the minute, and may be rendered irregular, and quite imperceptible, by the long continued action of <i>cold water </i>on the surface of the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>759. A shower or douche bath, delivering per minute from 30 to 40 gallons of water, at 64&#176; or 68&#176;, will occasion the immediate depression and reduction of the pulse to this extent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>760. A shower bath of eight gallons only, at 47&#176;, reduces the <i>volume, </i>but does not affect the <i>frequency </i>of the pulse. At 74&#176;, or 110&#176;, no perceptible effect is observed.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>763. The frequency of the heart&#39;s action increases in a corresponding ratio with the elevation above the sea-level.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>764. The question naturally arises, whether does this acceleration of the circulation depend on rarefaction of the atmosphere, or on the exertion and fatigue necessarily attendant upon ascending to aivy considerable elevation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>765. M. de Saussure, whose constant journeyings among the Alps afforded him the opportunity of forming, and whose scientific attainments enabled him to arrive at, an accurate estimate upon this point, thus expresses himself:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;It is necessary that a determinate quantity of air traverse the lungs in a given time. If the air be doubly rare the inspirations must be doubly frequent, in order that the rarity may be compensated for by the increase of volume. This <i>forced acceleration </i>of the respiration is the cause of the increased circulation, and of the fatigue and extreme distress experienced at great elevations.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>766. The <i>steepness of the ascent </i>is not the sole cause of the fatigue experienced in ascending. The rarity of the air at an elevation of 1,300 or 1,400 toises above the sea-level produces very singular effects. One of these is the extreme rapidity with which the muscular powers are exhausted. &quot;Si Ton persiste a faii&#39;e des efforts, on est saisi par des palpitations et par des battemens si rapides et si forts dans toutes les arteres que Ton tomberoit en defaillance si on l&#39;augmentoit encore en continuant de monter.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>&quot;</i>Some are seized, at a certain height, with nausea, vomit* ing, and even faintings, followed by a sleep of an almost lethargic character.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>767. <i>&quot;</i>Some individuals suffer,&quot; says M. de Saussure, &quot;when they attain to 800 toises (5114-96 English feet) above the sea-level; others at 1,200 (7672-4 feet), some at 1,500 or</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1,600 (9590-5 or 10229 9 feet).&quot; M. de Saussure, in common with the greater part of the inhabitants of .the Alpine regions, was not sensibly affected until he had reached to 1,900 toises (12,148 feet = 2-3 miles). Above this elevation those most accustomed to mountain travelling suffer whenever they move quickly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>768. M. Pictet, at an elevation of 1,400 toises above the sealevel, could never take more than <i>forty </i>steps without stopping to take breath, and was always seized &quot;d&#39;une espece d&#39;angoisse, d&#39;un leger mal de coenr et d&#39;un degout absolu.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>769. &quot;These effects,&quot; continues M. de Saussure, &quot; are not to be attributed to the difficulty of breathing, but <i>au rildchement des vaisseaux produit par la diminution de la force comprimante de Vair.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>770. M. Bouguer, in his <i>&quot;Voyage au Pe&#39;roit,&quot; </i>says, &quot;we were first inconvenienced by the rarity of the air; some suffered from slight haemorrhages from the lungs, occasioned doubtless by the atmosphere not being sufficiently dense to assist, by its compression, the blood vessels to return their contents. Several, when we ascended, fainted away and vomited. These symptoms <i>did not occur when they were on horseback.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>771. We have seen (56) that, at the sea-level, every point of the surface of our bodies sustains a <i>pressure </i>equal to that of a column of mercury 30 inches high, equivalent to a total pressure on the whole surface of 32,400 lbs. At an elevation of 7,500 feet this pressure would be diminished one-fourth = 8,100 lbs. . ,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>772. The effects of this diminished pressure, varying in degree in each individual, would be, according to Dr. Spier, &quot;vertigo, headache, dyspnoea, constriction of the chest, palpitation, syncopal tendency, oozing of blood from the mucous</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>surfaces, increased rapidity of the pulse, nausea, and vomiting, intense thirst, febrile tongue, muscular pain, sense of extreme debility in the lower limbs, and general prostration of strength,&quot; &quot;results arising,&quot; according to the same author, &quot;from a three-fold source: congestions of the deeper portions of the circulatory apparatus, increased &#39;venosity;&#39; in other words, impurity of the blood, and a loss of equilibrium between the pressure of the external air and that of the gases existing within the intestines.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>773. To these may be added faintness, singing in the ears, great acceleration of the respiratory system, and overpowering drowsiness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>774. M de Saussure endeavoured to ascertain by a series of observations the <i>extent </i>of the acceleration of the circulation <i>corresponding to any given altitude, </i></p>

At Chamounix, 2,040 feet above the level of the Lake of Geneva, our pulses, after repose, were respectively 49, 60, 72.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>776. On the summit of Roche Michel, 1,792 toises above the sea, and 783 above the post station of Mont Cenis, the pulses of M. de Saussure&#39;s party were 112, 112, 80, 104, 108, and 112; and at the post house, in the same order, 100, 96, 88, 100, 108, and 100, which gives a mean of the pulses, on the summit, of 104&#163;, and at the lower station of 98|.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>777. M. de Saussure, therefore, arrives at the conclusion that a fall of the mercurial column of 4 inches 2 lines occasions an acceleration of the heart&#39;s action of about 6 pulsations per minute.</p>

On the other hand, the town of Puno, near Lake Titicaca, in South America, 15&#176; 56&#39; south lat. 70&#176; 35&#39; west long, with 15,000 inhabitants, is situated at an elevation of 12,000 feet above the sea-level.

The mean annual temperature of latitude 15&#176; 56&#39; is 80-181&#176;; the elevation of the city of Puno, 12,000 feet, gives a fall of temperature (90) of 40&#176;, which, deducted from the mean temperature of the latitude, gives 40-181&#176; for the mean annual temperature of the city of Puno, 8-181&#176; above freezing point.

<p class='gtxt_body'>783. The capability of these elevated localities of sustaining animal life is mainly due to the purifying influence of vegetation, which, scanty though it be, consisting almost entirely of rushes, grasses, herbage, and green cereals, wheat, rye, and barley, the mean annual temperature not permitting corn to ripen <i>(4$3), </i>exhales, throughout the entire year, a certain amount of oxygen into, and absorbs an equal amount of carbonic acid gas from, the attenuated atmosphere, and thus contributes to render it more fitted for the respiration of man and animals than it would otherwise be. From the same cause the acceleration of the circulation and respiration <i>due to the respective altitudes </i>is doubtless diminished in a proportionate degree. The extreme rarity of the air, however, notwithstanding these advantages, occasions a difficulty of respiration both in man and animals, to which the name of <i>earochi </i>is given.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>784. It has been stated that but few of the monks of the Hospice of the Great St. Bernard can resist for any lengthened period the severities of the winter, which impair their health, and compel them to retire, with broken and ruined constitutions, to a lower and more genial clime.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>785. The hospice is 7,668 feet above the level of the sea, and 217 feet above the snow-line. If Dr. Parrot&#39;s calculation be correct, it will follow that at this elevation the heart&#39;s action would be accelerated upwards of 22 beats per minute. The question, therefore, suggests itself whether this accelerated circulation, and consequent quickened respiration, for a series of years, has not much more to do with &quot;impaired health, and broken and ruined constitutions,&quot; than the &quot;severities of a winter,&quot; the mean annual temperature of which is 32 09&#176;? (94)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>786. <i>Increased </i>as well as diminished atmospheric pressure invariably <i>quickens </i>the <i>respiration, </i>and, in some, the circulation; in others* the circulation is diminished.</p>

The blood is that vital fluid which circulates throughout the living frame, and supplies it with materials for the formation, development, and nutrition of all its parts, and with matter and power for the maintenance and purposes of life. It removes, by the excretion of special organs, the effete, decomposed materials from the various tissues of the body, and receives its supply of new nutrient matter from the <i>chyle </i>of the lymphatic vessels.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>790. In the <i>vertebrata </i>it is warm and of a red colour; <i>florid, </i>and approaching to <i>scarlet, </i>in the arteries, and <i>deep purple </i>in the veins.

<p class='gtxt_body'>793. The real nature of the blood corpuscles would still appear to be enveloped in some little uncertainty. The most careful observers differ as to their general structure, some affirming, and others denying, the existence of a nucleus.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>794. To the use of imperfect microscopic instruments, and to the dilution of the blood with water, may doubtless be attributed the discrepancies which have arisen with regard to the physical characters of the red particles of the blood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>795. The blood corpuscles in man, and in most mammalia, are circular and flattened&#8212;<i>discs</i>&#8212;with rounded edges and a central depression on each surface, the depth of which varies according to the amount of the contents of each globule. Their structure, which is homogeneous, and more dense externally than internally, consists chiefly of the proteine compound <i>globuline. </i>The blood corpuscles are endowed with great plastic properties, and are the seat of, and contain, the <i>haimatine, </i>or colouring matter of the blood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>796. Hassall has estimated their <i>average </i>size at sy^th, their <i>minimum </i>dimensions at <i>-^j^jth, </i>and their <i>maximum </i>at 52V?jth of an inch. Hewson has calculated their diameter to be from ^(jVs^<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> *&#176; STrVy^<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> of an inch, and their thickness about <i>\ </i>or <i>j- </i>of their diameter.

<p class='gtxt_body'>799. The existence of a nucleus is denied by Hassall, Majendie, Hodgkin, Liston, Young, Quekett, Gulliver, Lambotte, Owen, and Donne. &quot;The deep central depression on both surfaces of the blood disc,&quot; says Hassall, &quot;together with its little thickness, almost precludes the possibility of the presence of a nucleus.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>800. Delia Torre supposed each disc to have a central perforation, and an annular form.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>801. The blood disc is not a permanent structure, but one which is perpetually subject to destruction and renewal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>802. A continuous formation or reproduction of blood corpuscles is imperatively necessary to compensate for the consumption demanded for the exercise of the vital functions, and for the waste sustained in respiration, in the excretion of urine, abounding in urea (nitrogen and carbon), in the formation of bile, in the cutaneous excretion, in mucous and other discharges, and in the elimination of all effete matter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>803. Hewson is of opinion that the blood corpuscles are formed in the <i>spleen </i>from lymph granules. Schultz considers they are generated in the <i>lymphatic glands, </i>and that they receive their &quot;coloured capsule&quot; during the process of respiration. From the more accurate investigations, however, of Hassall, it would appear that they are <i>first met with in the chyle. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>804. &quot;The red corpuscles are&#8212;first, carriers of oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the system, and, secondly, are vehicles for the conveyance of carbon back again to the lungs.&quot; (883, 886.)</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>805. The proportion of the red globules may be regarded as a measure of the vital energy. They have been estimated by MM. Andral and Gavarret at 127 in every thousand parts of the vital fluid. In plethora they amount to 154, and in anaemia only to 100.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>806. According to Lecanu, the blood corpuscles consist of&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Fibrin 2-9480</p>
<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>Hasmatosine .... 2-2700 <br/>Albumin .... 125-6273 <br/></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>807. The <i>white globules, </i>or <i>lymph corpuscles, </i>are far less numerous than the red, from which they differ in size, colour, form, structure, properties, and use.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>808. Their average <i>size </i>is jyVcjtfi of an inch; their <i>form, globular; </i>and their <i>structure, granular </i>throughout, and <i>nucleated. </i>Their movements in the living capillaries are infinitely <i>slower </i>than that of the red corpuscles; and whilst these circulate <i>rapidly </i>in the centre or axis of the containing vessel, the former range themselves on the outsides of the current, moving <i>slowly </i>onwards, frequently adhering to the walls or sides of the vessels.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>809. It would therefore appear that the office of the red corpuscles is one of distribution, and that that of the white globules is intimately associated with nutrition, and the building up and repair of tissues, probably with secretion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>810. Mr. Addison is of opinion that the <i>white globules </i>are &quot;the foundations of the tissues and the special secreting cells, the link between the blood and the more solid structures, the unity from which the pluralities arise.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>and wherever nutrition is impeded, the colourless corpuscles accumulate in the vessels in increased quantities.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>812. Miiller believes the white corpuscles to be identical with the granular corpuscles observed in the lymphatic fluid, an opinion in which Hassall concurs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>813. Donne promulgates the idea that the white globules become ultimately converted into red corpuscles. Hassall, on the contrary, maintains that the white and red corpuscles are totally distinct from each other in origin, form, structure, chemical composition, and in function.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>814. Were the white globule to be transformed into the red corpuscle, it is just possible that botli nutrition and secretion would be retarded, if not totally suspended; and further, as a consequence of the increase in the number of red corpuscles arising out of such transmutation, a greater consumption of oxygen would take place in, and a larger amount of. carbonic acid would be eliminated from, the lungs in respiration, and a corresponding increased amount of animal heat would be developed, the combined result of which would contribute in no small degree to. a further wasting of the tissues of the body, already starved and attenuated from deficient nutrition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>815. The <i>molecules </i>or <i>granules </i>of the blood are very abundant and exceedingly minute, rarely exceeding the <span class="gstxt_sub">TTy</span>&#163;<span class="gstxt_sub">5</span>^th of an inch in diameter. The white globules are supposed to be developed out of the molecules by their union or aggregation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>816. During life the red corpuscles have an attraction for each other, but no affinity for the white globules, which, on the contrary, have an attraction for the walls of the vessels through which they circulate. After death, however, and in blood drawn from the living animal, this repulsive property between the blood discs and white globules ceases, and they readily cohere. This cohesion is termed the <i>coagulation </i>of the blood.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>817. The coagulum gradually separates into a pale strawcoloured or greenish-yellow liquid, <i>serum, </i>and a soft clot, <i>crassamentum. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>818. In venous blood the clot is to the serum as 65 to 34.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>819. The coagulation of the blood is prevented by all substances which dissolve fibrin, such as potassa, soda, and their carbonates: it is retarded by various salts, by sugar, by aether, and by bile; and is accelerated by mineral and vegetable acids.. Quain, on the contrary, says, acids delay or prevent coagulation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>820. The <i>inhalation of osther </i>is supposed to distend and rupture the corpuscles, and to suspend the elimination of fibrin, the consequences of which are an imperfect and diminished clot, and an increase of the serum. M. Magendie says, &quot;aether renders the blood fluid.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>821. In inflammatory disorders, a portion of the colouring matter of blood drawn from a vein subsides to the bottom of the vessel, and leaves the upper surface of the coagulum nearly colourless: this is the <i>huffy coat </i>of the blood, and is supposed to be nearly pure fibrin, and identical with that part of the blood termed <i>coaguldble lymph. </i>The buffy coat, according to Mulder, is an <i>oxide of proteine, </i>or a combination of fibrin and oxygen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>822. It has been asked, why does the blood remain fluid whilst circulating in living vessels, and why, on the other hand, does it coagulate in haemorrhage to plug up the bleeding vessel, in the ligatured artery, and when abstracted from the circulation?</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>824. Cessation of the blood&#39;s motion <i>within the body </i>favours coagulation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>825. Blood taken from a vein during the state of vital depression consequent upon infectious or malarious agents, flows with difficulty, is of a dark colour, and coagulates rapidly; the crassamentum, from a diminution or altered condition of the <i>fibrin, </i>is large and soft, and the serum small in quantity in proportion to the clot; all, evidences of the great reduction of the constitutional powers.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>826. Human blood has a saline taste, a weak alkaline reaction, and a peculiar mawkish odour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>827. Its <i>specific gravity </i>varies from 1-049 to 1-057. According to Nasse, the <i>average specific gravity </i>may be fixed at 1-055, and according to Zimmermann at 1056.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>832. It may not be altogether irrelevant to the subject under consideration, to allude to the original and important discovery which has within the last few years been made by Professor Claude Bernard, the successor of Majendie, with reference to the functions of the liver. This gentleman has ascertained that the liver in man and mammals <i>secretes a saccharine matter </i>&#8212; <i>glucose </i>&#8212; which is conveyed from the secreting cells by the inter&#8212; , intra&#8212; , and sub-lobular veins to the venae cavaa hepaticae, thence, in the course of the circulation, to the vena cava inferior and right auricle of the heart, and by the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where it is <i>burned, </i>thereby contributing to the sustentation of animal heat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>833. M. Bernard, after repeated experiments, and the most careful investigations, could not detect sugar in any other portion of the circulating system, and he therefore felt himself justified in asserting that sugar is a normal product of the liver, and that the saccharine matter, so secreted, cannot be detected <i>in health </i>in any secretion, vessel, organ, or tissue of the body, other than in the blood of the veins above mentioned, and in the substance of the liver itself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>834. M. Colin, of the Veterinary School of Alfort, near _ Paris, and, subsequently, M. Berard, Professor of Physiology</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>at the Faculty of Medicine of Paris, affirm that they have succeeded in obtaining sugar from the <i>chyle </i>of the larger ruminants fed exclusively on animal substances, thus shewing that sugar is <i>not secreted exclusively </i>by the liver. M. Fiquier, Assistant Professor at the School of Pharmacy of Paris, adds his testimony against the views advanced by M. Bernard.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>835. On the other hand, the experiments of M. Lehmann, of Leipzig, corroborate M. Bernard&#39;s opinions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>836. In order, however, to place the question beyond all doubt, the Acad^mie de M^decine of Paris appointed a Com</p>

mission to investigate this important matter. The Commission on concluding their investigations presented a report fully confirming all M. Bernard&#39;s original statements.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>837. But, even admitting, for the sake of argument merely, that sugar has been found in the chyle, this neither invalidates nor detracts from the importance of M. Bernard&#39;s discovery that the liver secretes, separates, or eliminates a vegetable substance, <i>glucose, </i>from animal matter alone, or from both combined; neither does it disprove his statement that the substance so produced assists, by its combustion in the lungs, in sustaining animal heat. It might, if satisfactorily established, tend to shew that even glucose may have its antecedents.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>838. Apart, however, from the interest which attaches to this discovery in a physiological point of view, it originates questions of the gravest import both to the pathologist and to the physician.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>839. If the quantity of saccharine matter secreted or separated be not entirely burned in the lungs, the surplus will circulate in the system, to be eliminated by the kidneys as diabetic urine.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>840. The question therefore arises, whether, in seeking for the cause of diabetes, we should not look to impaired, defective, or embarrassed respiration, the rather than to a faulty or perverted action of the assimilating organs, or of the kidneys themselves; and whether, in the treatment of this disorder, we should not suggest such measures as may contribute to the increase, where possible, of the respiratory functions, if these be in defect, and, as a consequence, to a larger consumption of glucose?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>841. Sugar has been constantly found in the urine of those whose respiration had become enfeebled by age.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>842. Again, if the liver, from disorder or disease, fail, either partly or altogether, in its glucogenic, as is constantly the case with its biliary function, the question may arise whether the saccharine matter, or, rather, that substance circulating with the vital fluid, whence the glucose is derived, separated, or<span class='gtxt_body'>
eliminated, may not be capable of inducing disorders other than diabetes.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>843. Under this division we shall consider the <i>changes </i>which the <i>atmospheric air </i>and <i>blood </i>undergo <i>during respiration. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>844. <i>Respirations, number of, per minute. </i>These are stated by Haller to average 20. Out of 1714 persons, Mr. Hutchinson found 510 to breathe 20 times in the minute. We may therefore consider this as the average number of respirations of a healthy adult man, whose heart beats 80 times in the minute.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>845. In the female the respirations and pulse are somewhat more frequent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>846. Respiration is modified by sleep, motion, distension of the stomach, &quot;vital capacity,&quot; affections of the mind, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>847. <i>Respiration </i>should bear a <i>due relation </i>to the <i>frequency of the hearts action. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Any marked variation between these should be looked upon as symptomatic of disorder or disease of the brain, spinal cord, heart, or respiratory organs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>848. <i>Air.</i>&#8212;During respiration <i>oxygen </i>is <i>absorbed </i>from the atmospheric air, and <i>carbonic acid gas given out. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It will be remembered (15) that atmospheric air consists of</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>850. <i>Carbonic acid gas.</i>&#8212;Philosophers of all times and of all nations have earnestly endeavoured to solve the problem of how much oxygen is consumed, and how much carbonic acid gas is given off during the process of respiration. The results of their experiments are as varied as the attempts have been numerous.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>851. The quantity of air which passes through the lungs at each inspiration has been variously estimated at from 3 to 100 cubic inches (706). The number of respirations per minute has been stated to be from 15 to 26.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>852. Assuming that a healthy adult male respires 20 times in a minute (844), and takes into his lungs, at each inspiration, 20 cubic inches of <i>air, </i>he would inspire 400 cubic inches in a minute, 24,000 in an hour, or 576,000 in 24 hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>853. Assuming, also, that the expired air contains 4 per cent, only of <i>carbonic acid, </i>he would evolve 16 cubic inches per minute, 960 per hour, 23,040 in the 24 hours, = 3,529 grains, or 7 oz. 2 drachms 49 grains of <i>carbon. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>854. Lavoisier and Seguin estimate the quantity of <i>carbonic acid </i>given off by the lungs of an adult man in 24 hours at 14,930 cubic inches; Davy at 31,680; Allen and Pepys at 39,600.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>855. Berzelius thinks there must be some error in the two last estimates, as it would require <i>6% </i>lbs. of solid food daily to make up the quantity of <i>carbon </i>(10 oz. 53 grs., and 10 oz. 5 dr. 48 gr.) said to be evolved.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>carbon per hour, or 7 ounces and a half in 24 hours, is probably as near an approximation to the truth as can be made in regard to the generality of men in adult age.&quot; He maintains that the consumption of 11&#163; ounces, as stated by some former observers, must be the exception, and applicable only to individuals of great stature, of very ample chests (of great &quot;vital capacity &quot;), and who eat largely.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>857. The importance of the subject, coupled with the-question of how much sustenance for man in the shape of food may be held sufficient to compensate for the carbon separated by the lungs alone, irrespective of that exhaled by the skin, eliminated by the kidneys, or carried off by the intestinal canal, induced MM. Andral and Gavarret to institute a series of experiments on a very extended scale, of which the following are the results:&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>858. The quantity of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs in a given time, from eight years to extreme old age, varies by reason of age (irrespective of weight or stature), sex, and constitution.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>859. At every age, from eight years upwards, the exhalation of carbonic acid from the lungs is greater in males than in females.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>860. In the <i>male </i>the quantity exhaled increases gradually and constantly from the age of 8 to 30 years; from 30 to 40 it is stationary, or rather tends to diminish; from 40 to 50 this tendency is more marked; and from 50 to extreme old age the amount is gradually reduced until it declines to that of the boy of ten years.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>861. In the <i>female </i>the amount given off from the age of eight years to <i>the period of puberty </i>continually increases. But upon the appearance of the catamenia it experiences <i>no further increase, </i>except during pregnancy, and <i>temporary interruptions </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of the periods, until the final cessation of menstruation, when an enlarged amount is <i>immediately </i>exhaled. As years roll on the quantity lessens, and observes the same laws which govern the male.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>862. An unimpregnated female, in perfect health, exhales 98-77 grains of carbon per hour; during pregnancy this amounts, on an average, to 123 grains. After the cessation of the catamenia the quantity exhaled, between 40 and 50 years of age, amounts to 129 64 grains; between 50 and 60, this falls to 112; between 60 and 80, to 104-75, a quantity, nevertheless, higher than in women quite regular, and 25 years of age. At 82 the exhaled carbon amounts to no more than 92-5 grains, a quantity very nearly corresponding with that given off by the male of 102.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>864. From these experiments it would appear that the average amount of <i>carbon </i>exhaled from the lungs of the male, from the age of 15 to 80 years, is 152 grains per hour, or 3,648 grains in the 24 hours = 7 ounces, 4 dr. 48 grains (856).</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>mum after meals and violent exercise, and about noon; and at its minimum about midnight. They also estimated the quantity expired during sleep at one-fifth less than that given off during the waking hours. This, however, has been shown to be incorrect. The diminution does <i>not depend on sleep, </i>for sleep, as sleep, <i>increases </i>the amount of carbonic acid gas expired, but, upon the <i>absence of light </i>(290). A man sleeping will expire more carbonic acid than if he lie quietly awake under precisely similar conditions of light, temperature, &amp;c. Moleschott has shown that in bright sunlight as much as. onefifth more carbonic acid is expired than in feeble light.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>866. Hunger, rest, fermented liquors, vegetable diet, and ptyalism, <i>diminish </i>the quantity evolved. Mental tranquillity, moderate exercise, and low atmospheric pressure, <i>increase </i>the amount exhaled.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>867. In accelerated respiration, the aggregate amount of carbonic acid evolved in any given space of time, will be in the direct ratio of the number of expirations, though the quantity given off at each expiration will be below the usual average. Thus, Vierordt found that with 6 respirations in the minute, the entire quantity of carbonic acid exhaled amounted to 11 cubic inches, with 12 respirations to 25&#39;3 cubic inches, and with 48 respirations to 44<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>5 cubic inches; whilst, in the first case, the expired air contained 5-7 per cent., in the second 4<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>l per cent., and in the last only 2<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>9 per cent, of carbonic acid.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>868. In a communication to the British Association it was stated, by Dr. Macgregor, that in the early stage of eruptive fevers, and in chronic skin diseases, the quantity of carbonic acid exhaled from the lungs is increased; in small-pox it amounts to six or eight per cent, in measles and scarlet fever to four or five per cent., and in ichthyosis has reached to 7<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>2 per</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>869. <i>Ammonia.</i>&#8212;Dr. Richardson has ascertained that ammonia in combination with carbonic acid gas is a constant constituent of expired air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>870. <i>Blood.</i>&#8212;The change which the blood undergoes in respiration is almost entirely confined to the red corpuscles. These, which represent in their independent act of metamorphosis the real vitality of the blood, and from which its fibrin is formed, indispensably require, for their healthy change, a due supply of oxygen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>871. The chemical process which ensues between the air and the blood is carried on through the delicate membranous lining and capillaries of the air cells.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>872. The permeation from without to within of living animal tissues, by gases and thin fluids, is termed <i>endosmosis </i>(from <i>evSov, </i>within, and <i>wafio^, </i>impulsion).</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>875. In the process of <i>expiration </i>the <i>carbonic acid </i>of the venous blood permeates this lining membrane, <i>exosmosis, </i>and is exhaled into the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>880. This change of venous into arterial blood, and its alteration of colour, depend on a separation of carbonic acid gas, which mixes with the air, and on an absorption of oxygen, which combines with certain constituents of the blood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>881. These constituents are the red corpuscles, which contain a <i>compound of iron saturated with oxygen. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>882. No other constituent of the body contains iron.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>883. In the circulation of the arterial blood through the peripheral capillaries, the iron, which is in the state of <i>peroxide, yields up its oxygen with the utmost facility. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>884. For every volume of oxygen so lost an equal volume of carbonic acid is <i>produced. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>885.

<p class='gtxt_body'>886.

<p class='gtxt_body'>890. For every volume of <i>oxygen </i>so <i>absorbed </i>a corresponding volume of <i>carbonic acid </i>is <i>separated. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>891. According to Valentin and Brunner, 0-9157 vol. of carbonic acid gas is given out for each volume of oxygen which disappears; and as one volume of carbonic acid gas includes one volume of oxygen, it follows that about one-tenth of the latter gas is concerned in the oxidisement of hydrogen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>892. Thus, two processes of oxidisation are going on simultaneously; the one in the <i>peripheral capillaries, </i>the other in <i>those of the air cells of the lungs. </i>In the latter we have a <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Charcoal </span><i>fire </i>constantly burning, by which the uniform temperature of the lungs is kept up; in the former, a <i>fire </i>of <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Animal </span>and <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Vegetable </span><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Fuel, </span>by which the heat of the body is supplied and sustained.

<p class='gtxt_body'>895. If, then, we know how much oxygen an animal consumes in twenty-four hours, and the quantity of carbonic acid and of water produced, the latter being ascertained from the bulk of the oxygen which disappears as gas, it is easy to calculate the whole amount of heat which is produced in respiration.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>896. The heat of combustion of pure carbon is, according to Andrews, 7,881 units of heat; that of Hydrogen 33,808.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>897. The <i>unit of heat </i>is the amount of heat which a weight of water, equal to that of the burned fuel, receives when its temperature is raised one degree of the centigrade scale.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>898. By the combustion of 1 atom of carbon = 6, and 2 of oxygen = 8 x 2 = 16, carbonic acid is produced. Now as carbonic acid contains time3 the weight of oxygen it does of carbon, it follows that one part by weight of oxygen, in its conversion into carbonic acid, yields 2,955 units of heat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>899. By the combustion of 1 atom of pure hydrogen = 1, and 1 atom of oxygen = 8, water is formed. Since water contains eight times the weight of oxygen it does of hydrogen, it results that one part by weight of oxygen in its conversion into water yields 4,226 units of heat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>900. The foregoing opinions on the agency of <i>iron </i>in the <i>absorption </i>of <i>oxygen, </i>and the <i>production </i>of <i>carbonic acid </i>during the respiratory process, are those of Mulder and Liebig. Scherer has recently satisfied himself that he has obtained the colouring matter of the blood <i>entirely free from iron. </i>Be this as it may, it cannot be questioned for an instant that iron, internally exhibited, restores the lost colour of the blood.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>so much rapidity as in the internal surfaces of the bronchia and air cells. One of the conditions on which these depend is the excessive vascularity of the respiratory organs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>902. Every tissue of the animal economy is more or less permeable to fluids. The more vascular is the structure the more highly is it endowed with this property.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>903. At each expiration a large quantity of vapour, called <i>&quot;pulmonary transpiration&quot; </i>makes its escape.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>904. The greater portion of this vapour is supposed to be derived from the chyle in its passage through the lungs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>905. The <i>aqueous vapour </i>of the air expired from the lungs is probably exhaled by the innumerable capillaries of the air cells, bronchial and respiratory surfaces.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>906. Its quantity is exceedingly variable, and dependent, to a considerable extent, upon the hygrometric condition of the atmosphere, the combustion of hydrogen during respiration, and the amount of fluids taken into the system with the foods, as well as upon the amount of secretion given off by the skin, kidneys, and alimentary canal. It may, however, be approximative^ estimated at about 3 grains per minute = 9 oz. in the 24 hours. Menzies calculated it at 2,880 grains = 6 oz., in the 24 hours; Abernethy at 4,320 grains = 9 oz.; Thomson at 9,120 grs. = 19 oz.; Hales at 9,792 grs. = 20 oz. 3 drachms 12 grs.; and Lavoisier at 13,704 grs. = 28 oz. 4 drachms 24 grains, in the 24 hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>907. The surface of the bronchia and air cells, in addition to the &quot; pulmonary exhalation,&quot; permits the escape of gaseous and volatile matters circulating with the blood. Thus, the breath of those who take aether, onions, or spirituous liquors, speedily acquires the odour peculiar to each.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Infection and Contagion. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>908. Much diversity of opinion exists on the subject of <i>infection </i>and <i>contagion. </i>Very many believe that the most pestilential disorders, typhus, yellow fever, the plague, Asiatic cholera, <i>et hoc genus omne, </i>are <i>not contagious, </i>that the poison exists in the atmosphere alone, and is not communicable by those labouring under its influence. Others conceive that the atmosphere immediately surrounding those suffering from any <i>infectious </i>disorder becomes contaminated by the diffusion of the exhalation from their lungs, and by the effluvia and emanations from their bodies, and that an <i>infectious, </i>but <i>noncontagious, </i>disorder thus becomes converted into a contagious malady.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>909. By common consent, however, most eruptive fevers are considered both <i>infectious </i>and <i>contagious. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>910. By <i>infection </i>we understand a contaminated condition of the atmosphere, by pestiferous, miasmatic emanations from the earth&#39;s surface, by poisonous gaseous exhalations the product of putrefactive changes of organic or vegetable substances, or by both combined, capable of tainting, polluting, or corrupting the body.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>911. <i>Infection </i>is a local taint of atmosphere originating <i>without </i>the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>912. Disorders produced by malaria, as intermittent, remittent, and yellow fevers, are <i>not communicable </i>by the sick to the healthy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>913. By <i>contagion </i>we understand the transmission of an <i>infectious </i>malady from the sick to the healthy, by pollution of the atmosphere by the effluvia or emanations from, or by the exuviae of, their bodies; or, by means of <i>fomites </i>imbued with the specific poison; or by immediate or mediate contact. In the latter case, the humidity of the atmosphere becomes a medium of contact.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>914. It seems to be a general law of animal nature, at least among the <i>mammalia, </i>that the accumulation and stagnation of the exhalations of the living body produce disease. The glanders of the horse arise only in stables where a large number of horses are stalled; and the distemper of dogs in kennels. During the American war it was proposed to send live sheep from England across the Atlantic. In a few weeks, in consequence of being crowded on ship board, they all died of a febrile disorder.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>915. <i>Contagion </i>may therefore be designated a specific virus originating <i>within </i>the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>916. A <i>contagiom fever </i>or disorder is produced by an <i>animal poison, </i>and <i>not </i>by <i>malaria. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>917. &quot;<i>Animal poisons </i>effect changes in the blood whereby they themselves are abundantly multiplied or reproduced. The eruptive disease which ensues seems to be the mode provided by nature for the escape or expulsion from the system of this newly-formed matter.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>918. &quot;A substance,&quot; says Liebig, &quot;in the act of decomposition, added to a mixed fluid in which its constituents are contained, can reproduce itself in that fluid exactly in the same manner as new yeast is produced when yeast is added to liquids containing gluten.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Thus, the virus of any specific animal poison will effect its own reproduction in the blood of an individual inoculated with it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>.919. Liebig shews that similar processes may take place <i>without </i>the reproduction of the added poison. In such cases the disorder or disease which results from the transformations that occur in the blood is <i>not contagious. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>920. In this way certain miasmata produce disorders which are not communicable from individual to individual.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>921. <i>Pycemia, blood poison, </i>(from <i>irvov, &quot;pus&quot; </i>and <i>alfia, &quot;blood&quot;) </i>is an instance of a poison generated probably by absorption of decomposing pus from an abraded mucous surface, or internal disorder, or from an external wound or disease. Of the former, aphthous ulceration of the tongue and internal fauces, inflammation of the uterine veins after parturition, an abraded urethra from the introduction of a bougie, are examples; and of the latter, amputations, whitlow, &amp;c. The absorbed pus spoils a considerable portion of the ingredients of the blood; these are deposited in the subcutaneous cellular tissue, in the substance of the lungs, in the joints, eyeball, &amp;c, in the form of unhealthy fibrin, which usually softens down into puriform fluid.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>922. Could we but bring our minds to believe that, in health, the power of resistance to disorder is superior to the force of the attack thousands of lives would be annually saved* Could we suppose the former to be always represented by 20, and the latter never to exceed 15, we should feel an inward sense of security against, and of power to repel disorder which would give us an almost perfect immunity from attack. But that most depressing of all agents, <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Feak, </span>will, at any instant,</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>suddenly reduce our power of resistance <i>below </i>15, and if this have been already diminished by previous ill health, by debility, by want of food, by cold and damp, by mental depression, by watching, by anxious attendance upon sick relatives or friends, irrespective of advanced age, we speedily fall an easy prey to disorder and pestilence.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>923. Hence the value, the advantage, nay, the necessity of preserving, during periods of pestilential invasion, a healthy tone of both the <i>morale </i>and the <i>physique. </i>If the former can be sustained by a prophylactery, a cabalistic charm, by a camphor bag, or by an amulet of any equally innocent character, are these to be despised and ridiculed; and if the latter can be supported by red meats and fermented liquors, or by quinine and iron, ought those to be doled out with a sparing or niggard hand, or these to be withheld?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>924. So well aware were the ancient Greeks and Romans of the influence of <i>fear </i>in the production of disease, that during the prevalence of any pestilential fever propitiatory sacrifices were offered to the divinities assigned to preside over fevers, the effect of which was to inspire the people with the most perfect confidence and courage. The Greeks invoked their divinity by the name of IIupeTos; the Romans worshipped <i>Febris. </i>The latter people erected no less than three temples for her worship; one on the Palatine Mount, another in the Via Longa, and a third in the place of the Monument Marius.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>925. Next after fear in the production of disease rank <i>depression of spirits, fatigue, scarcity of food, </i>and <i>exposure to a hot sun by day, and to the cold dew by night. </i>As an apt illustration of the combined effects of these, we may contrast the vigorous health of a victorious and pursuing army with the</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Miamxa and Malaria. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>926. <i>Miasma </i>(from <i>fiiaiva, </i>to pollute), a pollution, corruption; <i>malaria, </i>a vitiated or contaminated atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>927. Marsh miasm is a specific poison inducing specific effects upon the human body. These effects are produced in the ratio of the temperature, humidity, and electrical condition of the atmosphere; of the intensity, concentration, and activity of the miasm itself; of the duration of exposure; of the quantity inhaled and absorbed; and of the susceptibility or state of predisposition of those exposed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>928. In its mildest form, and in cold and temperate latitudes, miasmatic emanation gives rise to the ordinary ague, or intermittent fever of Europe; and in countries and intertropical climates, where, <i>in proportion to the intensity of the temperature </i>is the <i>intensity of power </i>in the miasm evolved, it produces the highest degree of aggravated remittent and ardent continued fevers, yellow fever, plague, or pestilential cholera. (966.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>929! The operation of malaria, when highly concentrated and most deadly, may be almost immediate. Thousands have been struck down, and have, from the potency of the poison, died in a few hours in the stage of collapse, the vital energies being impressed to the extent of subverting the power of reaction. In pestilential cholera patients have been stricken down almost lifeless and have died in a few minutes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>930. &quot;Fever,&quot; says Dr. Macculloch, &quot;may be induced within half an hour after exposure to malaria. A single inspiration, or the space of a very few seconds, is amply sufficient for the purpose. In France and Italy instances are recorded</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of labourers dying instantaneously from merely sitting or lying down on the ground; and of others, who, from looking into a ditch or drain, have been struck dead by that poison which, in a minor degree, would have merely produced a fever.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>931. When emanation is less copious or less virulent, or when the poison is freely diluted with atmospheric air, its operation is less sudden, and its effects are much milder.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>932. We have already seen that a healthy adult respires 20 times in a minute (844), and takes into his lungs, at each inspiration, 20 cubic inches of air, or 576,000 cubic inches in 24 hours (852); and that this respired air comes in contact, at each inspiration, with 201,600 square inches of mucous surface of air passages and cells (682). Is it, therefore, matter of surprise, that atmospheric air, contaminated by infectious or contagious matter, or poisoned by malarious, miasmatic, or paludal emanations, should exert its baneful influence on the . blood, and on the organic nervous system, through the nerves distributed to the enormous superficies with which it comes in contact at each inspiration? The wonder is that any of us escape. Indeed, where the percentage of contamination is large, few do escape. The history of the plagues and pestilences with which this and other countries have been visited during the last few centuries fully bears out this position.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>933. Dr. W. Fergusson states that the African and the Creole are, in a great degree, exempt from, and very rarely amenable to, those influences which generate in Europeans intermittent, remittent, or yellow fever.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>and physical properties, there is every reason to believe it to be an organic compound, composed chiefly of hydrogen and carbon, abundantly disengaged from the earth&#39;s surface by the solar rays, and diffused, during the day, through the atmosphere, and to be precipitated, after sunset, in a condensed form in proportion to the diminution of temperature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>935. <i>Marsh miasma </i>consists of gaseous matters, the product of purely chemical, or physical, or physiologically chemical actions, taking place within the earth, or upon its surface, in stagnant waters, or in the atmosphere itself. <i>(Schdnbein.) </i>In other words, marsh miasm consists of invisible and pestiferous emanations from the surface of the earth, and of poisonous gaseous exhalations and effluvia from animal and vegetable matter in a state of decomposition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>936. A certain degree of <i>moisture, </i>and a somewhat <i>elevated temperature, </i>are as indispensably necessary to the development</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>. of malaria as to the oxidising processes of decay and putrefaction. All these processes are alike suspended by <i>perfect dryness, </i>and by a temperature <i>below the freezing point. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>937. Dr. R. D. Thomson, Professor of Chemistry at St. Thomas&#39;s Hospital, examined the atmosphere of the cholera wards of that Institution, and found animal and vegetable life unequivocally diffused throughout it; fungi, or their sporules, and germs of vibriones, or vibriones themselves.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>938. In the external air, adjacent to the Hospital, during the epidemic cholera period, he found sporules with fungi to a considerable extent, but no vibriones.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>939. The atmosphere of a <i>sewer </i>was found to contain sporules, fungi, and vibriones.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>940. The external atmosphere and that of the wards possessed an acid reaction; that of the sewer gave an alkaline reaction.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>941. Mr. Rainey, Demonstrator of Microscopical Anatomy at St. Thomas&#39;s Hospital, also examined the atmosphere of the cholera wards, and found in it &quot; living organic bodies,&quot; which<span class='gtxt_body'>
were ascertained to consist of the mycelia of fungi apparently in an active state of vegetation, associated with more or less extraneous vegetable fibres. Besides the fungi, there was abundance of extremely minute, colourless, indistinctly beaded fibres, resembling in their general characters that form of vibrionia called &quot;bacterium.&quot;</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>942. Whether fungi or their spores, or vibriones or their germs, exist in marsh miasmata, has not yet been determined.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>943. We are told, on the authority of M. Boussingault, that the inhabitants of South America successfully withstand attacks of endemic diseases by covering the nostrils and mouth with a veil, so as to sift the air from all morbid particles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>944. <i>Marsh miasma </i>is peculiarly and naturally associated with marshes and swamps. &quot;. The essential character of these,&quot; says Dr. Macculloch, &quot;is, that the land should be partially inundated, that it should be dry in some places and wet in others, or that pools and dry spots should be intermixed, or that it should bo boggy and soft from the mixtures of earth and decayed vegetables with water, or that it should be subject to peculiar alternations of moisture and dryness, sometimes amounting to absolute inundation in the first case.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>945. Malaria abounds in swampy and marshy districts, but more especially in salt water marshes; on the drying or half dried borders of lagoons and lakes; on sandy plains which have been flooded and have subsequently become dry; on alluvial shores; on the deltas, and in the course of tidal rivers, whose mud banks, rich in decayed and putrefying animal and vegetable matters, arc twice in every twenty-four hours alternately covered and uncovered by the ocean tide, and as often exposed to the decomposing influence of the oxygen of the atmosphere &#8212;may be, to the heat of the solar rays.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>946. Loose, porous, sandy, alluvial, and argillaceous soils; deep, loamy, marly lands with a substratum of clay, affording capacity for the retention of moisture; plains and level countries presenting physical obstacles to underground drainage, are most favourable during a high range of temperature to the development and extrication, in all their virulence and intensity, of malarious exhalations, the <i>product of underground moisture, </i>of which the <i>surface gives no warning. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>947. Dr. William .Fergusson has endeavoured to prove that <i>inalaria, </i>and the products of <i>animal </i>and <i>vegetable </i>matter in a state of decomposition, are <i>three distinct things, </i>and, though often in company, have no necessary connection with each other; and that neither of the two last is essential to the production of pestiferous miasmata, or sufficient to generate fever; and, further, that the pestiferous quality of marsh miasmata does not necessarily depend upon <i>aqueous </i>putrefaction; that malaria never, under any circumstances, proceeds from open masses of water, but that, on the contrary, the mephitic emanations of marsh lands approaching to dryness from previous drought are corrected and destroyed by abundant rains, and the pestiferous lands themselves rendered perfectly healthy by accumulations of water on their surface.</p>

Pliny, who expresses the same opinion, and quotes the authority of Empedocles and Hippocrates to the same effect, states that the Athenians were cured of the plague by <i>lighting fires </i>near the houses of the sick. In more modern times the postmaster at a station in the Pontine Marshes preserved his health and flesh by keeping a fire constantly burning in his house day and night throughout the year. The cholera was arrested at Varna by the conflagration of the town.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>954. It is probable that malaria is decomposed or destroyed by the carbonaceous or mineral atmosphere of crowded and of manufacturing cities. Manchester and Birmingham passed through the cholera periods almost unscathed. This immunity from disease was attributed to the mineral matters from the numerous furnaces of these towns, with which the atmosphere was loaded.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>which he explained &quot;by admitting the diffusion of some gaseous body through the lower regions of the atmosphere considerably heavier than the air it displaced.&quot; &quot;About this day, the 9th of February, the first cases of epidemic cholera were reported in London.&quot; Dr. Prout &quot;believes that the virulent disease, termed cholera, was owing to the same matter which produced the additional weight of the air;&quot; and that &quot;the foreign body diffused through the atmosphere of London, in February 1832, was probably a variety of <i>malaria.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>958. On this day, at 3 <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>P.m., </span>the reading of the barometer, recorded at the Royal Society&#39;s House, was 30-395 inches. The mean weight of a cubic foot of air is stated by Mr. Glaisher to have been two grains above the annual average.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>959. Malaria, in consequence of its great <i>specific gravity, </i>is found in its utmost intensity in valleys, intermingled with mists and fogs; on the earth&#39;s surface, combined with the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere; entangled and stagnant in the coarse vegetation of the jungle of the East; in the dank grass, strong weeds, and dense brushwood of the West Indies; at the bottom of moats and ditches surrounding fortified towns; on the ground-floors of our dwellings; and in underground apartments.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>960. &quot;In all malarious districts and seasons the inhabitants of <i>ground-floors </i>are uniformly affected in a greater proportion than those of the <i>upper </i>stories. According to official returns, the proportion of those attacked in the lower apartments of the barracks at Barbadoes exceeded that of the upper by <i>one-third.&quot; </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>quences varied in different localities; and that, independently of any hypothesis, snch local varieties were found to be more nearly <i>inverse to the elevation of the soil </i>in the affected districts than proportionate to any other general influence.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>962. Thus, out of every 10,000 on or below the level of high-water mark, the mortality was 156; in the districts of 3 and under 20 feet of elevation, 91; of 20 to 40 feet, 44; of 40 to 60 feet, 36; of 60 to 80 feet, 23; of 80 to 100 feet, 17; and at 350 feet of elevation, only 10.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>963. Illustrative of the difficulty with which malaria attains to elevated situations, and ascends the mountain-top; significant also of the greater immunity from the effects of marsh miasmata enjoyed by these, compared with less elevated localities, Dr. Ferguson states that &quot; the British garrison of English Harbour, in the island of Antigua,&quot; &quot;were distributed, in 1816, on a range of fortified hills which surround the dockyard. The principal of these, Monks&#39; Hill, rises perpendicularly above the marshes to the height of 600 feet; another garrisoned hill, the Ridge, is about 100 feet lower; and a third, about 300 feet above the swamps, was occupied by seventeen artillery soldiers. The white troops in the two upper forts took the guards and duties of the dock-yard amongst the marshes below; and, so pestiferous was their atmosphere, that it often occurred to a well-seasoned soldier, mounting night-guard in perfect health, to be seized with furious delirium while standing sentry, and, when carried back to his barrack, to expire in all the horrors of the black vomit within less than thirty hours from the first attack.&quot; &quot;Those of the troops in the Monks&#39; Hill Barrack who were not obliged to <i>sleep </i>out of the garrison, or take the duties below, <i>remained in perfect health.&quot; &quot;</i>In the Ridge Barrack <i>scarcely any fever </i>worthy of notice occurred.&quot; &quot;The artillery</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>soldiers, who occupied the barrack 300 feet above the marshes, were <i>all </i>attacked with <i>remittent fever, </i>of whom one died.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>964. &quot;The solution here seems easy,&quot; says Dr. Macculloch; &quot;it is, that the malaria is especially united with that transferable substance which forms the foggy stratum, or that the lowest portion of the atmosphere, in the act of depositing water, is its vehicle and its residence.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>965. In Holland, America, and in this country, it is generally believed that malaria is conducted by common fogs, and that the pernicious nature of these is caused by the intermixture of malaria.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>966. Again, malaria is met with on <i>hills </i>and <i>elevated spots</i>Its <i>effects </i>are, however, <i>modified by altitude. </i>If the elevation be considerable, the <i>temperature will necessarily restrict the fever </i>arising from malaria <i>to the intermittent form; </i>whilst, in the plain beneath, the same noxious emanations would produce, in tropical climates, <i>remittent </i>or <i>yellow fever, plague, </i>or <i>pestilential cholera. </i>(928.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>967. In Sicily, according to Captain Smyth, out of seventysix unhealthy towns and villages, thirty-five are situated on hills and declivities. It is supposed that the <i>warm </i>southern winds not only produce, but readily waft upwards among the hills, the malaria of the emanating districts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>968. Assuming these localities to be free from all local malarious exhalations, is it not possible, indeed probable, that the miasmata of the lower districts are rendered specifically lighter, and are borne upwards to these thirty-five towns and villages on &quot;<i>clear </i>and <i>still nights,&quot; </i>by the radiation into successive strata of malarious atmosphere of a portion of that heat which the earth had acquired from the sun&#39;s rays during the day?</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Dr. Wells have ascertained that in <i>every clear and calm night </i>the temperature of the atmosphere <i>increases </i>with the distance from the earth to the height of at least 220 feet, and that at this elevation the atmosphere is frequently 10 degrees warmer than the stratum only 7 feet from the ground (91).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>970.- Marsh miasm is <i>borne by the winds </i>from place to place; indeed, it may be said to ride on the back of the atmosphere. Its progress is, however, retarded by lofty buildings, and its course altogether diverted by mountain chains.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>971. Lancisi tells us that, of thirty ladies and gentlemen who had sailed to the mouth of the Tiber, twenty-nine were immediately attacked with tertian ague, on the wind shifting and blowing over a marsh to windward of them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>972. During certain states of <i>stagnation of atmosphere </i>miasmata accumulate in and about towns and villages, but more especially in and among coarse damp vegetation and underwood.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>973. It has been remarked in the Campagna of Rome, that, if the labourers cut down certain bushy thistles, fever is the consequence. The malaria is supposed to be entangled within the vegetation, and to be let loose by this disturbance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>974. Dr. Fergusson is of opinion that the healthiness of seasons in unhealthy climates depends less on the amount of actual heat and moisture than on the <i>ventilation </i>of such localities by powerful and regular winds; and that towns and districts of country will be found, <i>caiteris paribus, </i>to be healthy or otherwise in proportion as they enjoy more or less of this purifying influence.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>removing all superabundant vegetation, brushwood, strong weeds, rank grass, &amp;c. from the immediate vicinity of the military stations of the island. The salutary effects resulting from this procedure having been brought before the late Commander-in-chief, his Grace the Duke of Wellington, and confirmed by the Director-General of the Medical Department of the Army, Sir James M&#39;Grigor, his Grace directed a &quot;<i>Circular&quot; </i>to be forwarded to all &quot;<i>General (or other) Officers commanding at Foreign Stations,&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">u</span> </i>enjoining the adoption of similar precautions in all the other military stations of our West India possessions.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>976. In the years 1845, 1846, <i>previously </i>to the draining, clearing, and cutting through the dense mass of vegetation in the vicinity- of the military station in the Island of St. Lucia, the proportion of deaths from fever among Europeans was no less than nine out of eleven . cases; whilst in 1847, <i>subsequently </i>to the cutting down and removal of the brushwood, the average was only one in eight cases.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>977. The noxious effects of malaria are, for the most part, produced in all their virulence and intensity in <i>autumn, </i>after the heat and drought of summer. The <i>hotter and drier </i>the preceding summer, the more frequent and more fatal are the autumnal fevers. The <i>colder and moister </i>the season the less frequent and less severe are the attacks.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>978. The emanations of malarious districts are most pestiferous and most active from <i>sunset to sunrise; </i>and, on account of their great specific gravity, are most virulent and intense <i>close to the surface of the earth.- </i>Hence the imminent peril of <i>lying down to sleep at night </i>in the open air in pestilential localities. Indeed, Lancisi strongly urges travellers not even to <i>cross </i>the Pontine marshes <i>by night. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>979. Nay, further, it has been remarked in many parts of Italy that the day-labourers are only safe so long as they observe the erect posture, and that if they sit or lie down on the ground they are in great danger, as though the poisonous matter extended to but a small altitude above it. (930.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>980. The generation of malaria is lessened or prevented by the <i>culture of the soil. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>981. Nothing checks the generation and propagation of malaria so much as dense population and <i>high cultivation. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>982. A certain amount of drainage may, however, just bring a swamp, which is too wet to produce miasmata, into that state which is peculiarly favourable to their extrication. The drainage of the marsh of <i>Chartreuse, </i>near Bordeaux, was followed, for many years, by a succession of severe forms of fever before unknown. In 1805,12,000 persons were attacked, of whom 3,000 died within five months.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>983. On the other hand, in districts naturally producing malaria, which have been suffered to fall out of cultivation, intermittent and remittent fevers multiply.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>984. The noxious qualities of marsh miasm are destroyed or absorbed in its passage across a river, or over the surface of even a small body of water. This is probably due to the presence of ozone resting on the surface of the water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>985. It would appear that when the mean daily temperature of the waters of a river in temperate latitudes, those of the Thames, for instance, exceeds 60&#176; Fah., and is, <i>at the same time, in excess of the minimum </i>temperature of the air, the waters will exhale into the atmosphere mephitic gases, the product of the putrefactive decay of such animal and vegetable matters as may be held in solution by them.

<p class='gtxt_body'>987. Pliny was of opinion that &quot;groves and trees <i>absorb </i>and <i>destroy </i>mephitic vapours.&quot; Dr. Macculloch, no mean authority, whilst admitting the &quot;real truth of Pliny&#39;s remark that trees destroy or consume mephitic vapours,&quot; denounces his &#39;theory to be unfounded, and his philosophy inaccurate.&#39; A country, says he, may become unhealthy by cutting down trees, and thereby exposing to the developing influence of the solar rays the wet and previously shaded ground; and, reversely, the planting of trees will sometimes check the production of malaria, by protecting wet lands from the action of the sun, and by absorbing and dissipating moisture.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>988. This reasoning is not conclusive. It may be suggested that in the former case terrestrial emanations were given off equally <i>before </i>as after the trees were cut down, but were <i>absorbed </i>by them; and that, in the latter case, terrestrial emanation was not &#39;checked but absorbed&#39; by the trees as rapidly as evolved.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>989. The result, however, of our experiences tends very considerably to confirm Pliny&#39;s view of the subject.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>990. We have seen (650, 651,) that plants, <i>during the day, </i>but more especially during <i>sunshine, </i>absorb from the atmosphere, and decompose, <i>carbonic acid, </i>and <i>restore </i>its <i>oxygen </i>to the air. &quot;We have also seen (652) that during the <i>night </i>the leaves of plants <i>absorb oxygen, </i>and <i>give off carbonic acid. </i>At least, if they do not <i>give off </i>carbonic acid, they do not <i>absorb </i>it.

<p class='gtxt_body'>emanations from the earth&#39;s surface, and the poisonous products of eremacausis, be <i>neutralised </i>and <i>respired </i>by the leaves of plants. Have we not seen (978) that malaria is most pestiferous and most active <i>from sunset to sunrise, </i>when plants <i>respire oxygen </i>and <i>give off carbonic acid, </i>when, in fact, they <i>cease to abiorb </i>carbonic acid, and, <i>probably, marsh miasm. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>991. The noxious effects of malaria are, for the most part, produced in <i>autumn, </i>when the last &quot; sere and yellow leaf&quot; has fallen to the ground, and all vegetation is preparing for its sabbatical rest, and leaving marsh miasm to do its deadly work unchecked and uncontrolled.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>992. If, however, during the <i>winter </i>months, we are deprived of the antidotal influence of vegetation in neutralising, or absorbing and decomposing, the noxious effects of malaria, we are mercifully supplied with another equally effectual and protective agent in the <i>low temperature </i>of this season of the year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>993. In warm latitudes and intertropical climates, where malaria abounds in all its intensity, many of the trees retain their foliage throughout the entire year, such as the lemon, the lime, the orange, the almond, the tamarind, the <i>Cupressus disticha, </i>the <i>Juniperus Virginiana, </i>the <i>Pinus tceda, Pinus palustris, </i>&amp;c.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>994. Returning <i>spring </i>brings vegetation to interpose its benign and kindly offices between us and marsh miasm; and, as though this were not sufficient to meet the exigencies of the summer season, we have mercifully superadded, for our requirements, an <i>elevated temperature, </i>as destructive of malaria as the cold of winter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>995. The violence of the plague itself is restrained within certain limits of atmospheric temperature, and does not spread when Fahrenheit&#39;s thermometer rises above 90&#176;, or sinks much below 60&#176;.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>996. It is an admitted truth that <i>peat bogs </i>do not generate, or at least do not emit, malaria. The question naturally arises, whether the peculiar <i>vegetation </i>with which the surface</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of these bogs teems during the summer months does not absorb or respire any malaria which may be exhaled from the surface of the earth, and whether, in winter, when the decay or death of this vegetation takes place, the <i>temperature </i>of these localities is not unfavourable to the extrication of malaria.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>997. It only remains to be shown that malaria abounds in its most concentrated and deadly form where <i>little or no vegetation exists to deprive it of its poisonous properties</i>; and that <i>where vegetation does exist in abmidancc, with free ventilation, malaria is rendered almost, if not entirely, innocuous. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>998. Dr. Ferguson writes: &quot;Another property of the marsh poison is its attraction for, or rather its adherence to, lofty umbrageous trees.&quot; &quot;In the territory of Guiana particularly, <i>where these trees abound, </i>it is wonderful to see how near to <i>leeward </i>of the most pestiferous marshes the settlers, provided they have this security, will venture, and that <i>with impunity, </i>to place their habitations.&quot; &quot;At Paramariboo, the capital of Surinam, the trade-wind, which regularly ventilates the town and renders it habitable, <i>bloios over a considerable tract of swamp </i>at a short distance, but which, fortunately for the inhabitants, is <i>thickly covered with umbrageous forests. </i>Experience, besides, has shewn, that there, as in all other new lands, the <i>cutting down of those trees in the swamps has ever been a fatal operation </i>in itself, and in all probability would <i>beproductive of pestilence </i>to the town.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>999. Numberless outbreaks of fever, of various types, during the peninsular war, are also recorded by Dr. Ferguson, and it will be seen that in almost every instance the locality in which the disorder appeared was <i>devoid of all vegetation. </i>The annihilation, by fever, of the British army at Walcheren is probably attributable to a like cause, the emanation of malaria from a sandy soil <i>devoid of trees and vegetation. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>summer, our troops took up the encampments of Rosendaal and Oosterhout, in South Holland. The soil in both places was a level <i>plain of sand, </i>with perfectly dry surface, where <i>no vegetation existed, </i>or <i>could exist, </i>but stunted heath plants.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1001. The same absence of vegetation at Walcheren is recorded by Sir Gilbert Blane. &quot;The whole island, with the exception of some hills, or rather mounds, of sand on the western shore, is a <i>dead flat </i>below the level of the sea at high water and preserved from inundation by dykes. The soil consists of a fine <i>white sand, </i>known in the eastern counties of England by the name of silt, and about a third part clay.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1002. The poisonous exhalations of the alluvial sandy plains of Zealand all but exterminated, in less than five months, a British army 43,521 strong, exclusive of reinforcements subsequently sent out. The expedition landed on Walcheren, and North and South Beveland, on the 31st July and 1st August, 1809. Sir Gilbert Blane reports on the 30th September, that no less than &quot;two-thirds of the whole numerical strength of the army were incapable of duty, and that the mortality averaged 250 per week.&quot; &quot;The total number of admissions into the hospitals in Zealand, between the 21st August and 18 th November, 1809, amounted to the incredible number of 26,846, including relapses, and that the number of sick, including a few wounded men, conveyed to England, between the 21st August and the 16th December, amounted to 12,863.&quot; &quot;Of 18,000 men left to garrison Walcheren, more than one-half died, or were sent to England on account of sickness during the three following months.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1003. The frightful amount of mortality experienced by this expedition is scarcely paralleled by the loss of the French army in their attempt on Naples in 1528, when, by choosing unhealthy encamping ground at Baia, an army of 28,000 was, <i>in a few days, </i>reduced to 4,000 men!</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1004. &quot;In June, 1809, the army advanced towards Spain, through a singularly dry rocky country, of considerable elevation, on the confines of Portugal. The weather had been so hot for several weeks as to dry up the mountain streams; and in some of the hilly ravines that had lately been water-courses, several of the regiments took up their bivouac. Several of the men were seized with violent remittent fever before they could move from the bivouac the following morning. Till then it had always been believed that vegetable putrefaction (the humid decay of vegetables) was essential to the production of pestiferous miasmata; but in the instance of the half-dried ravine before us, from the stony bed of which (as soil never could lie for the torrents) the <i>very existence even of vegetation toas impossible, </i>it proved as pestiferous as the bed of a fen.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1005. &quot;After the battle of Talavera the army retreated into the plains of Estramadura, along the course of the Guadiana River, at a time when the country was so <i>arid </i>and dry, for want of rain, that the Guadiana itself, and all the smaller streams had, in fact, <i>ceased to be streams, </i>and were no more than lines of detached pools in the courses that had formerly been rivers, and there they suffered from remittent fevers of such destructive malignity, that the enemy, and all Europe, believed the British host was extirpated.&quot; &quot;The aggravated cases differed little or nothing from the worst yellow fevers of the West Indies; and in all the subsequent campaigns of the Peninsula the same results uniformly followed, whenever, during the hot seasons, any portion of the army was obliged to occupy the <i>arid </i>encampments of the level country, which at all other times were healthy.&quot;</p>

It is situated on a rocky bank of the river Agueda, a remarkably clear stream; but the approach to it on the side of Portugal is through a <i>hare </i>open hollow country, that has been likened to the dried-up bed of an extensive lake; and upon more than one occasion, when this low land, after having been flooded in the rainy season, had become as dry as a brickground, with the <i>vegetation utterly burned up, </i>there arose to our troops fevers, which for malignity of type could not be matched by those before mentioned on the Guadiana.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1008. &quot;At the town of Corea, in Spanish Estramadura, not very dissimilarly situated, on the banks of the Alagon, our troops experienced similar results. The shores of the river (it had no confining banks) seemed perfectly dry, and there was <i>not </i>an <i>aquatic weed, </i>nor a speck, nor line of marsh to be seen within <i>miles </i>of the town, nor anything but dry, <i>bare, </i>and clean savannah.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1009. &quot;From all the foregoing it will be seen that in the most unhealthy parts of Spain we may in vain, towards the close of the summer, look for lakes, marshes, ditches, pools, or <i>even vegetation. </i>Spain, generally speaking, is then, though as prolific of endemic fever as Walcheren, beyond all doubt one of the driest countries of Europe; and it is not till it has again been made one of the wettest, by the periodical rains, with its <i>vegetation </i>and <i>aquatic weeds restored, </i>that it can be called healthy, or even habitable, with any degree of safety,&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1010. Sullivan, in his &quot;Visit to Ceylon,&quot; advances similar opinions on the subject of the absorption by plants of noxious exhalations. &quot;The vicinity of tanks and lagoons of the most foetid and agueish character is perfectly healthy. These are covered in abundance with various kinds of aquatic plants, the lotus, of almost Victoria Regia magnificence, which, by a kind Providence, are made to serve not only as filterers and purifiers of the water itself, but even as consumers of a considerable portion of the noxious exhalations that would otherwise poison the neighbourhood.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1011. &quot;A forest,&quot; says Mr. Haviland, &quot;intervening between a pestilential marsh and a city often affords a protection to the inhabitants, and perchance the pestiferous air gets decomposed into innocuous gases during its enlargement among the trees.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1012. At Lisbon, and throughout Portugal, are <i>numerous </i>and <i>extensive gardens, </i>for the supply of which, during the three months&#39; absolute drought of the summer season, water is preserved in very large stone reservoirs. The water falls into the <i>most concentrated state of foulness and putridity, </i>diminishing and evaporating day after day, till it subsides either into a thick green vegetable scum, or a dried crust. These reservoirs may be seen in this state close to the houses, even to the sleeping-places of the household, in the atmosphere of which they literally live and breathe; &quot;yet no one ever heard or dreamt of fever being generated amongst them from such a source, though the most ignorant native is well aware that, were he only to cross the river, and sleep on the <i>sandy shores </i>of the Alentejo, where a <i>particle </i>of water at that season had not been seen for <i>months, </i>and where water, being absorbed into the sand as soon as it fell, was <i>never </i>known to be <i>putrid, </i>he would run the greatest risk of being seized with remittent fever.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>highly pestiferous plain. The northern bank, on the contrary, is perfectly healthy. The country on this side is hilly, and the foundation of the soil, and of the beds of the streams, is of basaltic rock, covered here and there with limestone. The quintas, or gardens, are of <i>considerable extent, </i>and for the most part contain <i>plantations </i>of <i>orange and olive trees. </i>These latter abound in all open spots. The <i>cypress and judos trees, elms and poplars, </i>are also met with in abundance in the surrounding country.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1014. &quot;It is a remarkable fact,&quot; says Dr. Watson, &quot;that, though the provinces of North America, especially North and South Carolina and Virginia, are full of ague, that disease is never seen among the inhabitants of the <i>Dismal Swamp</i>&#8212;a moist tract of 150,000 acres on the frontiers of Virginia and North Carolina.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1015. The <i>&quot;Dismal Swamp&quot; </i>extends from north to south nearly 30 miles, and averages from east to west nearly 10 miles. It is covered, in common with all the other swamps of that country, with <i>evergreen trees </i>of <i>huge </i>and <i>lofty stature. </i>The deciduous cypress, <i>taxodium distichum, </i>attains a height of 120 feet; the red cedar, <i>Juniperus Virginiana, </i>reaches to 80 feet; the pines, <i>pinus tceda </i>and <i>pinus palustris, </i>from 60 to 80 feet. All these <i>retain their foliage throughout the entire year. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1016. The convent of St. Stephano became <i>unhealthy in consequence of cutting down some trees; </i>and the <i>extirpation of a wood </i>brought on <i>severe fevers </i>at Velletri, during a space of <i>three years. </i>The <i>same results </i>occurred, <i>from like causes, </i>at Campo Salino, in the Pontine Marshes.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1018. In later times, says Lancisi, a <i>forest </i>to the southward of Rome, reaching from the heights of Frascati and Albano to the Tiber, which protected it from malaria, so abundantly generated in that quarter by marshes, was <i>extirpated, </i>and <i>destruction </i>first let in upon the Campagna. A <i>similar </i>proceeding, in another quarter, exposed the Eternal City itself to the <i>malaria </i>of these localities.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1019. In 1695, after a great overflowing of the Tiber, the inhabitants of Rome were attacked with agues and remittent fevers, with the exception of those who resided in one particular quarter of the city, &quot;which <i>was protected by a belt of trees around it.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1020. Although lakes and marshes have now comparatively disappeared under various attempts at drainage, Castiglione is infamous for its pestilential air, the plain of Latium and the country surrounding Rome are <i>uninhabited deserts, </i>and the Eternal City herself is frequently sorely visited by fevers of a remittent form, which, we are told by Dr. Armstrong, are &quot;<i>attributed to the felling of forests,&quot; </i>which protected her from the pestilential emanations of the surrounding miasmatic districts.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><i>as a tolerably sure indication of the presence of malaria. </i>Whilst, on the other hand, it has been as clearly shown (998, 1009, 1010, 1014, 1017, 1018, 1019) that the <i>absence of malaria may be fairly inferred from the presence of vegetation. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1022. Whether, then, vegetation act by <i>absorbing </i>and <i>decomposing </i>marsh miasma, or by <i>exhaling oxygen </i>into the atmosphere, is of little moment. In the former case, the miasma is destroyed by the vegetation, <i>directly; </i>in the latter, <i>indirectly, </i>by the conversion, through the agency of electric influences, electrical discharges, and thunder-storms, of the excess of oxygen exhaled into the atmosphere, into <i>Nature&#39;s grand and universal disinfectant, </i>OZONE.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1023. In either case it is worthy of consideration whether swamps, moors, fens, and marshes may not be rendered comparatively salubrious, or at least innocuous, by planting them with a fair amount of evergreen trees and shrubs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1024. Practically, then, we are taught, in the choice of encamping grounds for troops, to avoid marshes, fens, and moors, valleys, and low-lying lands, limestone rock, and arid and sandy soils, the banks of tidal rivers, and the course of dried-up water-streams, but, more especially, should we shun malarious localities if destitute of vegetation, or if this exist in a scanty degree only.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1025. If necessity, however, compel an encampment near to marsh or paludal lands, care should be taken that the tents be pitched on the windward side of the emanating districts; and, where possible, that trees intervene between these and the troops. If the former be impracticable, and the latter do not exist, large fires should be kept constantly burning between the camp and the malarious lands.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1026. On the other hand, we are taught to select high-lying lands, gravelly or chalky soils, well-wooded districts, a southern aspect, sheltered from the north and east winds by mountains or hills, but more especially by umbrageous trees or dense and lofty forests.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1027. Inseparably associated with marsh miasma, and all but identical in their effects upon the human body, are the pestiferous and morbific exhalations elaborated from imperfect drains, open sewers, and cesspools of towns and cities.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1028. In all large cities and towns there are plague-spots where fever of the intermittent, remittent, or continued form always prevails in greater or less intensity. There are districts and localities in our modern Babylon which are ever emitting the poison which generates typhus fever; there are certain squares and streets, nay, particular houses, the inmates of which, family after family, for a long series of years, have been the victims of typhus fever, though the districts in which they are situate are airy, and the soils dry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1029. Open and imperfect common sewers, faulty, superficial, choked up, and overflowing drains, imperfect traps of cesspools and water-closets, a filthy condition of the earth&#39;s surface, together with intramural burial-grounds, slaughterhouses, and slaughtering-cellars, and the conversion of tidal rivers into cloacae maximae, are the fruitful sources of fevers, diarrhoea, and dysentery in all congregations in any one spot of huge multitudes of human beings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1030. There is probably no subject so complex, so incalculably difficult to grapple with, especially if it be how to apply a remedy, as the drainage and sewerage of large overgrown cities. Yet, we must perceive, that unless this be efficiently done, an ultimate limit is set by the hand of man himself to dynasties, to peoples, and to nations. The air we breathe, loaded with carbonaceous matter, sulphurous, and sulphuric acid, sulphate of ammonia, and sulphuretted hydrogen (18), is deprived, by the absence of vegetation, of the revivifying principle oxygen, and is hence less fitted for the necessary changes of the blood effected during respiration. The earth which we tread under our feet, loaded with the ashes of our forefathers,<span class='gtxt_body'>
and rich with the remains of animal and vegetable matter of ages long gone by, saturated with the putrefying contents of myriads of cesspools and leaking sewers of our own day, emits, at certain seasons of the year, the poisonous emanations which generate typhus, diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera; whilst the waters of our principal tidal rivers, converted into open common sewers, teem with pestiferous exhalations charged with the germ of disease or the messenger of death. If, under these favouring conditions, a pestilential epidemy invade our shores, it finds us an unprepared and easy prey.</span></p>

The Government of every state and nation would do wisely to appoint a Minister of Public Health, whose duty it should be to superintend and watch over the health of the community at large, to see that due ventilation is observed in all large and public buildings, and in the dwellings of the poor; to ascertain that the water is pure, and its supply ample; to prevent all noxious and unwholesome trades and manufactures being carried on within a given distance from towns and dwellings; to prohibit intramural burial-grounds, slaughterhouses, and slaughtering-cellars; but, above all, to lay down, and carry out, an effectual, efficient, complete, and commonsense plan of drainage and sewerage for every town and city.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1032. The beneficial results likely to accrue to the communities of large towns in particular, and to the whole country at large, by the appointment of a Ministry of Health, may bo estimated, comparing small things with large, by contrasting the diminution in the mortality of the &quot;<i>City</i>&quot; of London, under the able and judicious supervision of Dr. Letheby, the &quot;medical officer of health&quot; appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, with that of previous years.</p>

The length of the public sewers in the City itself is upwards of 50 miles; and of the metropolitan public sewers, including brick and pipe sewers and open ditches, upwards of 1,334 miles:&quot; all of which discharge their pestilential contents in the very heart of our great metropolis, into the river Thames, which thus becomes &quot;the common recipient of filth from a population exceeding 2,500,000 souls, from thousands of domestic animals, and from an average of 1,787,459 cattle annually slaughtered within its boundaries.&quot; Its waters are thus &quot;polluted <i>per minute </i>by a sewage flow on its north bank of 13,489 cubic feet, or 84,077 gallons; and on its south bank by 4,565 cubic feet, or 28,454 gallons.&quot; &quot;The <i>daily </i>quantity of feculent sewage discharged into the river on its north side amounts to 9,712,690 cubic feet, or 60,535,720 gallons; and that on the south side to 3,287,550 cubic feet, or 20,490,122 gallons: amounting together to 13,000,239 cubic feet, or 81,025,842 gallons; and <i>annually </i>to&quot; the astounding and fabulous quantity of &quot; 29,574,432,330 gallons.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1037. The Commissioners, to whom was referred the consideration of the plans proposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, (1045,) estimate the amount of sewage which daily pollutes the Thames from the metropolitan district alone at 15,249,777 cubic feet. This quantity, however, in consequence of the prospective increase of the population of the metropolitan district from 2,362,236 in 1851 to 3,979,089, will amount, estimating seven cubic feet of sewage per diem for each individual, to 27,853,623 cubic feet, or rather more than 170,000,000 gallons daily!</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1045. It is now nearly three years sinco an Act was passed by the Legislature, for the prevention of the pollution, by sewage, of the river Thames. This Act provided that large intercepting sewers should be made for the purpose of diverting the sewage from the Thames. During this period various plans have been suggested to the &quot;Metropolitan Board of Works,&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and by them submitted to the &quot;Chief Commissioner of Her Majesty&#39;s Works and Public Buildings&quot; for approval, by whom they were referred to a Committee of Engineers, Messrs. Galton, Simpson, and Bakewell. Amongst other plans proposed was one by Mr. Bazalgette, 22nd December, 1856, which contemplated the construction, at an outlay of 4,000,000?., of huge sewers, for the purpose of conveying to Erith Reach the daily increasing amount of excrementitial sewage from our overgrown modern Babylon.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1046. The Commissioners, after six months&#39; mature deliberation, report that &quot;the proposed outfall in Erith Reach is objectionable, because it would not effectually prevent the sewage from returning within the limits of the metropolitan boundary; because it would have a deleterious effect on the health of the district; and because it would probably be prejudicial to navigation.&quot; They conclude by suggesting that &quot; the best outfall on the north side is a place between Mucking Lighthouse and Thames Haven, in Sea Reach, and that the best outfall on the south side is Higham Creek, in the Lower Hope.&quot; The estimated cost of this extension of Mr. Bazalgette&#39;s plan is 5,437,265*.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>and rivers of which are similarly polluted in the ratio of the adjacent population. That which applies to the river Thames applies equally to the rivers of all our large towns and cities. The Liffey has been denounced in the House of Lords by Lord St. Leonard&#39;s as &quot;an absolute pestilence in the neighbourhood of Dublin, in consequence of its being made the channel for the whole sewage of that city.&quot; <i>Ab uno disce omnes. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1048. Dr. Copland objects to this plan, that it will increase the evil it is designed to remedy, and that if the sewage of the metropolis be conveyed to the German Ocean by means of a prolonged sewer, the river will of necessity be diminished to one-half its present size, its mud-banks be exposed to solar and atmospheric influences, and that the production of malaria will, as a consequence, be increased in intensity and amount.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1049. He suggests that several ample tanks be provided on either bank of the river, and that the sewage be conveyed thither for the purpose of deodorization and disinfection by means of the cream or hydrate of lime, combined with wood or peat-charcoal, soot, or coarsely-powdered coke, for the purpose of retaining the ammonia; that the <i>fluid or watery portion thus disinfected and deodorized be returned to the river, </i>and that the <i>more solid parts be employed for agricultural and horticultural purposes, </i>of which they possess every requisite. (1041.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1050. In reply to Dr. Copland&#39;s objection, it may be stated that the supply of fresh water is fully equal to the demand. It will be shewn (1061) that the various water companies abstract from the river 35,372,782 gallons of water daily, and that the amount of evaporation from the 2,245 acres constituting the bed of the river at London has been estimated</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>at 4,170,000 gallons daily, (1055,) together amounting to 39,542,782 gallons. On the other hand, it has been computed that 800,000,000 gallons of fresh water, in a tolerable state of purity, derived from the various sources and tributary 1049. Op. cit. p. <i>2i. </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>streams of the Thames, descend through Teddington Lock every twenty-four hours. The construction of the lock precludes the ascent or reflux of water below it. The only tributary streams above London Bridge, the waters of which may be said to be absolutely pure, are the Wandle and Bavely Brook.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1051. It may possibly be advanced that common <i>brick </i>sewers permit the percolation of a portion of their fluid, and the escape of a certain amount of their gaseous contents, whereby the surrounding soil becomes saturated and polluted. In the construction of sewers, therefore, it were much to be desired that some substitute of a more efficient kind, and better adapted for the purpose in view than bricks, could be devised.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1052. Mr. Gurney, in his Report to the First Commissioner of Works, suggests the <i>combustion of the noxious gases of sewers. </i>The attempt has been made to effect this both in this country and in Belgium, but, in every instance, it signally failed, in consequence of the large amount of atmospheric air with which the gases of the sewers were commixed, and of the very high temperature to which carburetted hydrogen, and all elements of combustion, whether gaseous or not, must be brought before they will ignite.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1053. As impure water and impure air are inseparable, we can readily understand that the River Thames must necessarily exercise a most baneful influence upon the salubrity of those towns east of Brentford through which it flows in its course to the sea. Its whole area presents <i>one large evaporating surface, </i>which exhales, day and night, incessant and vast volumes of vapour surcharged with the mephitic effluvia and impurities arising from animal and vegetable matter in all stages of decomposition, suspended in its waters or cast upon its banks, and of which the atmosphere is the ready recipient.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>In short, the Thames acts as a laboratory for the general diffusion of noxious gases, prolific in quantity and intensity in the ratio of the excess of the temperature of its waters over that of the superambient atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1054. It has been ascertained by Mr. Glaisher that the amount of water evaporated from the surface of water exceeds 30 inches in depth annually.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1055. The bed of the River Thames at London is estimated approximately at 2,245 acres; therefore, 2-5 x 43,560 = 108,900</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1056. During calm, clear weather, these emanations, consisting of sulphuretted and carburetted hydrogen gases, of nitrogen and carbonic acid gas, free ammonia and other vapours (1041), ascend high into the atmosphere, where they become generally diffused, but in their descent on cooling they spread broad-cast the seeds of disease and death; but during cloudy, moist weather, and particularly during calms, and the colder air of night, they are condensed into haze, mist, or fog, and occupy the lowest districts, the inhabitants of which are the earliest and the most numerous victims.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1057. Mr. Glaisher observed that for three weeks previous to the outbreak of cholera in London, in June, 1854, the temperature of the water of the Thames had gradually increased, and that when it had attained to 60&#176;, and the atmosphere had</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1059. The greater the difference between the temperature of the water and that of the air, the more dense will be the mist or fog.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1060.

<p class='gtxt_body'>water of the River Thames, collected at Chelsea and near Hungerford Bridge, in August 1854, was &quot; turbid, opalescent, of a yellow colour, and disagreeable taste and smell, and teemed in abundance with dozens of species belonging to different classes and orders of living organic productions. It also contained the debris of food derived from the waterclosets and sewers of the metropolis, and certain species of diatomaceas, found only in brackish water.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1063. As instances of the intensity and activity of the poisonous nature of the emanations arising from <i>sewers, drains, </i>and <i>cesspools, </i>the following may be adduced.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1064. In August 1852, an attempt was made <i>&quot;</i>to improve the sanitary condition of Croydon,&quot; by the introduction of a system of tubular underground drainage, &quot; with syphon-traps for the escape of foul gas.&quot; &quot;The pipes were too small, the joints were not water-tight, and admitted air out, and water in.&quot; &quot;Much water, loaded with the disgusting part of house sullage, was at first, during the whole day, visibly admitted to the river, and afterwards to the ditches of the adjoining fields,&quot; causing a most intolerable nuisance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1065. This impotent and abortive attempt at &quot;sanitary improvement,&quot; by converting a river into an open common sewer, was attended with and followed by an alarming outbreak of fever, diarrhoea, and dysentery.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1066. &quot;Out of a population of 16,000 persons, there occurred 1,800 cases of fever, with a mortality of <i>sixty, </i>and <i>very numerous cases </i>of diarrhoea and dysentery, with a mortality of <i>ten.&quot; </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1068. In October, 1845, it was found necessary to empty a huge cesspool situate in the centre of a large mansion occupied by several families. Within three hours after the opening of the cesspool, one member, and speedily afterwards five others, of one of the families, was attacked with vomiting and purging. Of the other families, eighteen were attacked with diarrhoea and dysentery, of whom one, a celebrated and highlygifted physician, died on the third day after the opening of this pestiferous pit.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For months afterwards diarrhoea and dysentery fastened upon every family who took up their residence within this malarious mansion. The evil was eventually remedied by filling up with quick-lime the pit, over the mouth of which the watercloset of the house was placed. The trap of this was now discovered <i>to be defective, permitting the constant escape of the poisonous emanations of this pest-hole. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1069. &quot;Four or five individuals were attacked with typhus fever after having transacted business in a nobleman&#39;s kitchen which had been inundated with a filthy fluid.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1070. &quot;During the cleansing of the drains of a gentleman&#39;s house, the inmates were seized with <i>typhus fever.&quot; </i>&quot;Four individuals were attacked by <i>typhus fever </i>during the clearing of a dirt-hole in another gentleman&#39;s house, of whom the latter fell a victim to the disease.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1071. Two of the servants of a gentleman&#39;s family residing on an elevated and peculiarly healthy locality became the subjects of intermittent fever, and one other of remittent fever, in consequence of the bursting of a drain which ran beneath the floor of the butler&#39;s pantry.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1072. When, however, we consider the amount of eremacausis, and of putrefaction of animal and vegetable matters, constantly taking place on almost every point of the habitable globe, the question naturally obtrudes itself, How comes it the whole atmosphere is not polluted by their miasmatic gases to an extent to render it poisonous and unfit for sustaining animal life?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1073. Nature has mercifully supplied us with a natural and abundant disinfectant <i>ozone, </i>(331,) the office and property of which appear to be to destroy all oxidisable mephitic emanations and miasmatic exhalations with which the atmosphere is constantly contaminated, and thus to preserve and sustain its purity unsullied.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1074. The quantity of ozone necessary to purify miasmatised air is exceedingly minute.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1075. From experiments instituted by Schonbein, it appears that atmospheric air, containing but 3^5^^ of ozone, is capable of disinfecting its own volume of air loaded with the miasmata given off in one minute by 4 oz. of flesh in a high state of putrefaction.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1076. Atmospheric ozone in destroying oxidisable miasmata suffers destruction in its turn. This is one of the reasons why ozone, though continually engendered, cannot accumulate in the atmosphere to an extent which would be prejudicial to animal life. (341, 342.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1077. During the cholera visitations in 1849 and 1854, the absence of ozone on the water-level, and in low-lying districts, was constantly noticed and recorded. It must not, however, be supposed because the presence of ozone was not evidenced by the ozonometer, that none was generated in these low situations equally with more elevated localities. The explanation is to be found in the fact, that in effecting the decomposition of the malarious emanations of these low districts, the ozone was</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>expended and suffered destruction in its turn. As, however, malaria, in all its intensity, was rapidly and abundantly evolved, and as the electrical action of the atmosphere during these periods was comparatively feeble, not to say inert, it resulted that ozone was not generated in a corresponding degree, or in quantity sufficient to neutralise the fearfully large amount of miasmatic gases, <i>of greater specific gravity than the atmosphere itself, </i>constantly exhaled into it. This interpretation will also explain its presence, though in small quantity, on higher ground, and its greater abundance at considerable elevations, and will equally account for the greater virulence and mortality of the cholera in low districts, and its diminishing intensity in the ratio of elevation. (961, 962.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If, therefore, the quantity of miasmatic gases given off exceed the quantity and quality of the ozone formed at the same time, some kind of epidemic will, to a greater or less degree, prevail.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1078. Of all seasons of the year <i>winter </i>is that in which the atmosphere abounds with ozone, and is most free from oxidisable miasmatic matters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1079. The higher strata of the atmosphere are more ozoniferous than the lower, and contain less oxidisable miasmatic matter than those which are nearer the surface of the earth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1080. <i>Disinfectants,</i>&#8212;If nature have bountifully supplied us with her own universal disinfectant ozone, art has contributed her share in providing us with many powerful antiseptics, disinfectants, and deodorisers. Of these are the various compounds of chlorine, chloride of soda, of lime, and of zinc, hypochlorite of potassa, or chloride of potassa, and chlorinated potassa, and hypochlorite of soda <i>(Labarraqae&#39;s disinfecting fluid), </i>sulphurous acid, the vapour of nitric and of muriatic acid, oxygen, kreosote and magnesia, and various other substances.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1081. Chlorine (from %\a&gt;po?, <i>green) </i>is a yellowish greencoloured gas, of an astringent taste, and disagreeable odour.<span class='gtxt_body'>
It is one of the most suffocating gases, and excites spasm and great irritation of the glottis when respired, even though considerably diluted with atmospheric air. Its specific gravity, according to Davy, is 2-395.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Chlorine has a very strong attraction for hydrogen, and is indirectly one of the most powerful oxidising agents which we possess. It decomposes and resolves into harmless products the organic matters of which infection and contagion appear to be composed, and renders innocuous, by seizing on their hydrogen, the volatile principles given off by putrefying animal matter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1082. The compounds of chlorine, on exposure to air, absorb carbonic acid gas, and evolve chlorine.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1083. Mr. Condy, of Battersea, has recently introduced to the notice of the profession and of the public &quot;<i>a disinfectant fluid,&quot; </i>of which the chief constituent is <i>&quot;condensed oxygen.&quot; </i>It is said not only to deodorise and disinfect perfectly, but also to destroy absolutely the cause of infection. It possesses one most important advantage over chlorine, that it is not poisonous, does not evolve any noxious or unpleasant smell, and may be employed to purify water. In short, it is a near approximation to ozone, and promises entirely to supersede chlorine as a disinfectant. It is favourably noticed by the Board of Health as &quot;<i>a true disinfectant.&quot; </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1084. Disinfectants are useful in destroying the mephitic and noxious emanations of drains, urinals, privies, cesspools, stables, and cattle-sheds, and the contagious and infectious matter of sick rooms and hospitals.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1085. It is self-evident that the inlluence exercised by disinfectants must be of an exceedingly limited nature, of a purely local character, and of a very ephemeral duration.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1087. It is obvious from that which has preceded, that in our private dwellings, our barracks, hospitals, and union houses, too much care cannot be paid to the <i>arrangement </i>and <i>construction </i>of the drains, nor too much thought be bestowed on the drainage generally. The drains, where possible, should communicate, at a proper fall, with the common sewer; they should consist of glazed earthen tubes, or of iron pipes, well and carefully cemented together: <i>brick </i>barrel or square drains are highly objectionable, in consequence of the porous nature of the material of which they are constructed. The drains, which should not pass through the house, should be flushed twice, or at least once in every week. With this view there should be an <i>ample supply of water, </i>averaging at the lowest calculation seven cubic feet = 43-67 gallons per day for each inmate. ,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>But, above all, it is most important that the drains be in good order; that there be no leakage of their fluid contents, nor escape of foul air, and that the traps of the closets be in perfect repair. If the drains of the house communicate with the common sewer, it is imperative that one or more &quot;<i>dip,&quot; </i>or other kind of traps, be placed near the communication, in order to prevent the emanations of the sewer finding their way into the house on occasions of high winds or tides.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1088. The surface drains of the streets, of courts, alleys, yards, and stables, should be placed under the surveillance of an officer, part of whose occupation should be to see that the scavenger does not neglect his duty.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The gratings of the surface drains should not be trapped with a view to prevent the escape of noxious emanations generated within the sewers; they should be left open, to allow the free entrance of atmospheric air to dilute their<span class='gtxt_body'>
poisonous exhalations. Were the contrary course to be pursued, these foetid and mephitic gases would find their way, in the highest state of concentration, into every house the drains of which communicate with the common sewer.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1089. Cesspools and soil-pits, unless steined and cemented, should be prohibited, lest their fluid contents saturate the soil, and contaminate the adjoining wells.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1090. In almost all large towns, companies for the supply of pure water to the inhabitants have been formed. Were it rendered <i>compulsory </i>where these exist, and the water-supply is adequate to the wants and requirements of the population, that every house, tenement, stable, and manufactory should derive their water from these sources, irrespective of public or private wells, it would go far to improve the sanitary condition of towns and districts. Rival companies would vie with each other in supplying the inhabitants at the least possible cost, which, if found necessary, might be fixed or regulated by the local government; or the water might be supplied by this latter, and the attendant expense levied on the. householder in the form of a tax based on the assessment to the poor&#39;s rate. In any case, an inspector should be appointed to ascertain that the supply is equal to the demand, that the source is pure, and the water uncontaminated.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>VENTILATION.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1092. We have been already told that the healthiness of seasons in unhealthy climates depends very considerably on the due ventilation of such localities by powerful and regular winds, and that towns and districts are rendered healthy, or otherwise, in proportion to the amount received by them of these purifying influences. (974.) We have also been officially informed of the salutary effects resulting from the admission of free ventilation to our military stations in the West Indies, by the cutting down and removal from their immediate vicinity of all superabundant vegetation, rank grass, and brushwood, in which malaria is prone to become entangled. (975, 976.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1093. We have now to enter upon the importance of extending these principles to our dwellings, our hospitals, gaols, barracks, union houses, factories, churches, theatres, and all other public buildings in which large numbers of persons assemble or are congregated together. It is not our province so much to enter into the mode in which this is to be effected, as to discuss the principle itself, to inculcate the importance of observing a more natural, and consequently a more rational, system of ventilation, with a view to the promotion of health, the prevention, mitigation, or arrest of disorder and disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1094. The objects of ventilation are&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>a. </i>To expel all poisonous and infectious gases from our dwellings, whether the products of combustion, respiration, or overcrowding, or the emanations of drains, sewers, and cesspools, or of putrescent animal and vegetable matter.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>b. </i>To equalise the temperature and remove all excess of, and supply any deficiency in, the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere of our dwelling or sleeping apartments.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1095. The paramount necessity of due ventilation, whether in our private dwellings, public buildings, or in large assemblies of persons, will be self-evident, when we bear in mind that a healthy adult man inspires 24,000 cubic inches of air in an hour, or 576,000 in twenty-four hours, and that the expired air is found to have <i>lost </i>from 4 to 6 per cent, of its <i>oxygen </i>and to have <i>acquired </i>from 3-5 to 5 per cent, of <i>carbonic acid gas. </i>(852, 849.) Assuming that the expired air contains 4 per cent, only of <i>carbonic acid, </i>he would evolve 960 cubic inches per hour<span class="gstxt_sub">}</span> 23,040 in 24 hours = 3,529 grains, or 7 oz. 2 drachms, 49 grains of carbon. (853.) In addition, however, to the amount of carbon thus given off by the lungs, we must take into calculation that exhaled by the cutaneous surface, amounting, according to Scharling, to one-fifth of an ounce per day = 576 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas; and, according to Dalton, to one-fourth of an ounce of carbon = 720 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1097.

The <i>minimum </i>quantity has been calculated at about one-third this amount, viz. 8-8 grains per minute = 2 pounds, 2 ounces, 3 drachms, 12 grains, in twenty-four hours; and the <i>mean </i>at 18 grains per minute = 4 pounds, 6 ounces.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>&#8212; 28 ounces, 4 drachms, 24 grains. The <i>average </i>amount may be estimated at 3 grains per minute = 9 ounces in twenty-four hours. (906.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1099. The <i>insensible cutaneous transpiration </i>averages, according to Lavoisier and Seguin, 11 grains per minute</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>&#8212; 33 ounces in twenty-four hours, an amount nearly equal to the renal secretion. As, however, this depends so materially on the temperature and hygrometric condition of the atmosphere, it were better to take a lower estimate, 8-8 grains per minute = 26 ounces, 3 drachms, 12 grains in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1100. An atmosphere saturated with moisture interferes with the cutaneous and pulmonary exhalations. In dry weather both are increased twofold.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1101. Adopting this calculation, the sum of both secretions, the <i>cutaneous and pulmonary, </i>would amount to 2 pounds, 11 ounces, 3 drachms, 12 grains in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1102. The <i>cutaneous exhalation </i>is a <i>true secretion </i>from the blood, somewhat analogous to that of the urine, of those matters which, at the temperature of the body, are capable of assuming the gaseous form, such as carbonic acid and water. It varies before and after meals, and is at its maximum immediately after dinner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1103. The <i>pulmonary transpiration, </i>on the contrary, is<span class="gstxt_sub">(</span> according to Mr. H. Milne Edwards, the <i>effect solely of evaporation. </i>Its amount is diminished in the ratio of the moisture of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1107.

<p class='gtxt_body'>1119. As the products of the combustion of coal, carburetted hydrogen, carbonic acid and sulphurous acid gases, and water, escape, for the most part, by the flue of the chimney, and do not add to the contaminations of the atmosphere of the room, it is perfectly unnecessary to enter into any detail on the subject of their respective amounts. It is sufficient to shew the large amount of deterioration of the atmosphere effected by the <i>consumption of its oxygen in the combustion of the coal, </i>and the large supply of fresh air which this necessitates.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1120. As, however, the quantity of coal consumed, in consequence of varying draught, is never twice alike in the same house, or even in the same stove, we can but attain to an approximative amount of the consumption of oxygen by open coal fires. It has been shewn above that every ten pounds of coals requires 120-57 pounds of oxygen = to that contained in 1,575-55 feet of atmospheric air. Let us assume that the atmosphere is robbed of only <i>half </i>this amount of oxygen, and we shall readily admit the necessity of free ventilation, and the admission of pure air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1121. It has been estimated by Dr. Arnott that each adult individual vitiates, <i>per minute, </i>by respiration, 400 cubic inches of air, and by pulmonary and cutaneous transpiration, three cubic feet. The fires, lamps, and candles are calculated by Mr. Tredgold to deteriorate at the rate of one-fourth of a cubic foot <i>per minute </i>for each individual. Hence it follows, that every individual, in a room artificially lighted and warmed, will require, at the least, three-and-a-half cubic feet of pure air per minute. Vierordt considers two and a half sufficient: Peclet thinks five cubic feet necessary: Dr. Reid is of opinion that the quantity should not be less than ten feet: Dr. Arnott and Dr. Roscoe consider this insufficient, and that at least</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1122. If the amount of impairment and vitiation of the atmosphere produced by <i>one </i>individual be multiplied by the number of persons congregated or assembled together, and that effected by <i>one </i>gas burner, lamp, or candle, by the number of artificial lights, a tolerably accurate estimate, duo regard being had to the size of the building, will be formed of the amount of the combined deterioration, and of the supply of fresh air necessary to support life and sustain combustion.</p>

One or two examples will suffice:&#8212;Her Majesty&#39;s Theatre is capable of containing 3,000 persons, exclusive of the <i>troupe, </i>the orchestra, servants, and attendants. The number of gas and other lights amounts to 1,234. Admitting that, at the lowest calculation, (Vierordt&#39;s,) each of the spectators, including the lights, requires only two and a half cubic feet of fresh air <i>per minute, </i>(1121,) it results that the enormous amount of <i>seven thousand five hundred cubic feet </i>of pure air must, or ought to, find ingress into the house <i>each minute, </i>for the sustentation of life, and the combustion of gas and other lights, and an equal quantity of vitiated atmosphere must find an escape during the same brief space of time. If, however, the highest calculation hold good, (that of Dr. Arnott and Dr. Roscoe,) (1121) the quantity of fresh air which ought to be admitted, and the amount of deteriorated air which should escape, <i>each minute, </i>will amount to <i>sixty thousand cubic feet. </i></p>

In a closed room of the Wellington Barracks, of which the capacity is 7,920 cubic feet, 16 guardsmen slept from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m.; a low fire was kept burning in a common wide grate, over which was an open ventilator. In 10,000 volumes of the air of the room, collected 2 ft. 6 in. from the floor, Dr. Roscoe found 12&#39;42 volumes of carbonic acid gas. The supply of fresh air was ascertained to be 13-3 cubic feet per minute for each man.

Sir Gilbert Blane says that &quot;in calculating the arrangements of an hospital, 600 feet is the smallest portion of space which ought to be allotted to each person;&quot; and that &quot;if it fall much below this, it will be found impossible to maintain a due purity of the air.&quot; &quot;The portion of cubic space allowed to each patient in St. Thomas&#39;s Hospital was from 700 to 1,000 feet.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1129. The minimum amount of space which should be allotted to each patient in civil and military hospitals is 1,000 cubic feet. In the new wards of the <i>London Hospital </i>1,700 cubic feet are calculated for each person. Slaves in slave-ships have, however, existed for weeks in a space of 14 cubic feet. The golden rule is to give to each individual as much space as possible, and to ventilate that space freely.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1130.

Too much care is bestowed in the endeavour to make floors, ceilings, windows, and doors air-tight. There is too great a dread of draughts and currents, and consequently too scant a supply of. fresh and pure air. The secret of the avoidance of draughts consists not in excluding the open air, but in admitting it freely. In summer, when the difference of temperature between the outer and inner air is comparatively small, and when, as a consequence, the ventilation by chimneys and windows is less efficient than in the colder seasons, the housemaid &quot;adds fuel to fire,&quot; by taking especial care to keep the flaps of the register stoves hermetically closed, lest the bright bars should be soiled by the descent of dust, soot, or rain-drops. In winter the windows are rarely opened. Carpets for floors, sand-bags for doors and windows, sash-fastenings and pegs, list, brown paper and paste, are all so many hindrances to free and perfect ventilation, and a constant source of the <i>&quot;</i>smoky chimney,&quot; or of the &quot;back smoke,&quot; which descends the unused flue, in order to supply the fire with that oxygen which we have exercised so much-ingenuity to shut out.

In addition, the fire-place is frequently kept closed, or is blocked up by chimney-boards, or bags of straw, &quot;in order to prevent a downward draught.&quot; In the attics and upper chambers fireplaces are often altogether wanting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1135. The Report of the Commission to which reference has been already made (1130) lays great stress on &quot;the fetid and unwholesome atmosphere of the barracks in which the men of the Foot Guards sleep, the habitual breathing of which, though producing for the most part no direct immediate effects, probably lays the seeds of that pulmonary disease which is so fatal to the British army.&quot;&#8212; <i>Vide </i>1126, 1121.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1136. This is scarcely a fair representation of facts, as it would lead to the inference that this vitiation of the atmosphere arises <i>of necessity {vide </i>1126), and that it predisposes to phthisis. Every medical officer knows that the habits and prejudices of the soldier render it next to impossible to ensure that amount of ventilation of which the arrangements of his hospital admit. Every adjutant will echo this so far as barrack and guardrooms are concerned. It is notorious that the soldier in hos. pital, in barrack, and in the guard-room, will, in spite of the utmost vigilance, close every aperture, even to the key-hole, against the external air. The disease of the soldier is set down to the system, to the severity of his duties, and to the utter disregard, by his officer, of his comfort and his health. How severe soever the duties may be, neither the first nor the last holds good. -The &quot;young agriculturist of 19,&quot; fresh from his native village in the weald of Sussex, or the fens of Lincolnshire, suddenly finds himself a guardsman, in the midst of the allurements and debaucheries of a London life. Of these he tastes but too freely, as the &quot;hospital returns&quot; testify. His duties are severe; the discipline adds to their severity. If, having been recently dismissed the hospital, he come off sentry, his great coat saturated with rain, and enter the pestiferous<span class='gtxt_body'>
atmosphere of an over-heated guard-room, of which every crack and cranny is stuffed with paper to make it if possible air-tight, he first roasts himself before a huge fire, and next lies down to sleep on the guard-bed, without being permitted so much as to unhook a hook, or unbutton a button of his wet great coat, much less to take it off, lest the guard should be &quot;turned out.&quot; In the midst of a profuse perspiration this occurs, or he is &quot; told off&quot; to form one of the relief, and to take again his two hours&#39; tour of duty, may be, to be posted in some unsheltered part of St. James&#39;s Park, or on the ramparts of the Tower, exposed to all the severities of a cold north-east blast, and perhaps, in addition, to the noxious emanations of the Thames, or the Tower ditch (1056, 959).</span></p>

The mortality of the army has been contrasted with that of the country generally, and it has been -stated in the report, on the authority of the Registrar-General, that, of effective men of all ages of the army at home, the annual mortality in the thousand is 17 -5, while in the general population it is, for men of the army ages in the town and country 9-2, and in the country alone 7-7.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1140. This fearful difference is to be sought, not in the &quot;fetid and unwholesome atmosphere of the barrack-room,&quot; not<span class='gtxt_body'>
in the limited and narrowed hospital breathing-room, not in the &quot;boiled beef,&quot; on which the Life and Horse Guards live and fatten, and on which the Guards are said to pine, and fade, and die, but on the more severe duties of the latter, as compared with the Household Cavalry Brigade and the Line. The duties incident to a West India colony are less severe than those of a battalion of Guards doing duty in the Tower of London, within the morbific influence of the mephitism of the river Thames.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1141. Let the guard-room, the barrack, and the hospital be <i>effectually </i>ventilated and objectional offices removed; let the severity of the duties of the Guardsman, when possible, be lessened; let the discipline of the guard-room be relaxed when urgent necessity appears to demand it; let the diet of the soldier be varied, and the Thames no longer converted into a common sewer, and we shall find that the health of the Guards and of the army will compare, <i>cceteris paribus, </i>with the civil population of the united kingdom.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1142. It is, however, in the habitations of our poorer brethren that the results of deficient ventilation, or of its total neglect, are witnessed in all their concentrated virulence and intensity. Dr. Letheby, the officer of health of the City of London, states, in his &quot;<i>Report on the Sanitary Condition of the City of London&quot; </i>for the quarter ending March 28, 1857, presented to the Commissioners of Sewers, that in some of the rooms of the haunts of filth and misery which it was his duty to visit, he found &quot;the atmosphere so close and unwholesome, infested with that peculiarly fusty and sickening smell so characteristic of the filthy haunts of poverty,&quot; that he &quot;endeavoured to ascertain by chemical means whether it did not contain some peculiar product of decomposition, to which might be attributed its foul odour and its rare power of engendering disease.&quot; He &quot;found that it was not only deficient in the due proportion of oxygen, but that it contained <i>three times the usual amount of carbonic acid, </i>besides a <i>quantity of aqueous </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1143. Dr. R. Angus Smith, of Manchester, in his experiments on the <i>air and water of towns, </i>has demonstrated that the condensed air of a crowded room yields a deposit of a thick glutinous mass, having a strong animal odour. This deposit becomes, in a few days, converted into a <i>vegetable growth, </i>which is followed by the production of <i>multitudes of animalcules, </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1145. If, therefore, it be true, as has been stated before, on the authority of Sir Gilbert Blane, (914,) that &quot;it seems to be a general law of animal nature, at least among the <i>mammalia, </i>that the accumulation and stagnation of the exhalations of the living body generate fever and disease,&quot; there is little difficulty in explaining the large amount of disease and mortality observable in the habitations of the poor, as a consequence of the impurities of the air of their dwellings and the exhalations from their bodies not being promptly and efficiently carried off by due ventilation, and of the amount of oxygen consumed not being adequately supplied by the admission of a proportionate quantity of fresh air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1146. The question next arises how is the atmosphere of rooms and buildings, rendered unfit for the purposes of respiration and combustion, to be resupplied, and how is the vitiated air to find an escape.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>atmospheric air, ascends with the heated effluvia towards the ceilings and upper parts of dwelling-rooms and sleeping apartments, where it becomes condensed and subsequently descends, commixes with and contaminates <i>equally, </i>in accordance with the laws of the diffusion of gases (11), the <i>whole air of the room. </i>A portion escapes by the upper parts of the closed doors, and by the crevices and openings between the windowframes and sashes, but by far the larger part is rapidly carried off by the flue of the chimney. This is the most powerful ventilator of the room, and continually abstracts and removes a large stream of heated and vitiated air sufficient to change the entire atmosphere of the room, provided there be an average amount of <i>open </i>doors, windows, and crevices to yield a corresponding supply of pure air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1148. The fresh air enters by the windows, doors, and crevices. It has been estimated that eight cubic feet of air will pass per minute between each window-frame and the sashes. But, as this supply of fresh air has to be equally divided among the occupants of the room, it has been found that in crowded school-rooms, dormitories, barracks, and other places, this natural or accidental ventilation scarcely affords four feet per head per minute, a quantity sufficient, doubtless, to sustain life, but not to preserve rude and vigorous health.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1149. Dr. Roscoe has shewn that the beneficial action of the <i>brick and mortar walls </i>of our dwellings is not confined to the mere absorbing from or restoring moisture to the atmosphere, but that it extends to a very large diffusive interchange between the carbonic acid gas of the apartments and the external atmosphere; that, in fact, <i>brick walls </i>are powerful aids to ventilation. Dr. Roscoe ascertained that in a closed space, the air of which contained 16 per cent, of carbonic acid gas, 325 per cent, escaped in two hours through the solid brick.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>is probably partly accounted for by the absence of all diffusive interchange through iron and through wet walls.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1151. Newly-built houses, and houses how long soever they may have been built, though exposed for years to the action of dry air, are unhealthy when first inhabited. The lime of the dry hydrate of the mortar of their walls combines with the carbonic acid abundantly supplied by the lungs and skin of their first occupants, and parts with and sets free as moisture the 24 per cent, of water chemically combined with it. The water thus displaced speedily evaporates and saturates the atmosphere of the various rooms, its excess being condensed in drops on the windows and cold walls. This does not depend on ordinary moisture or dampness of the walls, but on the retained water of the hydrate, and must invariably occur on the first occupancy of any building into the walls of which lime enters as a component.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1152. Liebig suggests that in close rooms and on shipboard deficient ventilation may be compensated for by the use of hydrate of lime. Eighteen or twenty pounds of slaked lime will absorb 38 or 39 cubic feet of carbonic acid gas, which would be immediately replaced by an equal volume of fresh air entering through the crevices.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1153. From all that has preceded it would appear that that against which wo have the most to be on our guard in our <i>private dwellings </i>is the emanations of cesspools, drains, and sewers, and <i>carbonic acid gas </i>howsoever generated: and in our <i>public assemblies </i>carbonic acid gas, elevated temperature, and an atmosphere surcharged with aqueous vapour, and the exhalations of the skin, and pulmonary mucous surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1154. In any and every case the ample and free admission of fresh air and the complete and ready escape of the contaminated atmosphere are all that can be desired or attained. If we err, better that we err with too much than with too little</p>

This brought on a raging thirst, which increased in proportion as the body was drained of its moisture. Various expedients were thought of to give more room and air. Every man was stripped and every hat put in motion. They several times sat down on their hams, but at each time several of the poor creatures fell and were instantly suffocated or trodden to death.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Before nine o&#39;clock every man&#39;s thirst grew intolerable and respiration difficult. Efforts were again made to force the door, but still in vain. Many insults were used to provoke the guards to fire upon the prisoners, who grew outrageous, and many of them delirious. &#39;Water, water!&#39; became the general cry. Some water was brought; but these supplies, like sprinkling water on fire, only served to raise and feed the flames. The confusion became general and horrid, from the cries and ravings for water, and some were trampled to death. This scene of misery proved entertainment to the brutal wretches without, who supplied them with water that they might have the satisfaction of seeing them fight for it, as they phrased it; and held up lights to the bars, that they might lose no part of the inhuman diversion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Before eleven o&#39;clock most of the gentlemen were dead, and one-third of the whole. Thirst grew intolerable; but Mr. Holwell kept his mouth moist by sucking the perspiration out of his shirt-sleeves, and catching the drops as they fell like heavy rain from his head and face. By half an hour after eleven most of the living were in an outrageous delirium. They found that water heightened their uneasiness, and * Air, air!&#39; was the general cry. Every insult that could be devised against the guard, all the opprobrious names that the viceroy and his officers could be loaded with, were repeated to provoke the guard to fire upon them. Every man had eager hopes of meeting the first shot. Then a general prayer to heaven to hasten the approach of the flames to the right and left of them</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;About two o&#39;clock in the morning they crowded so much to the windows that many died standing, unable to fall by the throng and equal pressure around. When the day broke the stench arising from the dead bodies was insufferable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>&quot;At that juncture the Soubahdar, who had received an account of the havoc death had made among them, sent one of his officers to inquire if the chief survived. Mr. Holwell-was shewn to him,* and it was near six when an order came for their release.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Thus they had remained in this infernal prison from eight at night until six in the morning, when the poor remains of one hundred and forty-six souls, being only twenty-three, came out alive, but most of them in a high putrid fever.&quot; f</p>

It has been repeatedly observed that in mills and factories the workmen invariably exclude, to the utmost of their power, the external air, not so much from the nature of their occupation as from choice. If the overseer insist upon the ventilators being kept open, the operatives strike for increase of wages, on the ground that fresh air quickens their appetites and occasions a larger demand for food than their wages will admit of their procuring.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1160. On the same principle the half-starved Dunstable bonnet-makers huddle and pack themselves together into the smallest possible space in a close, unventilated room, without fire, during the winter months, endeavouring by the emanations from their own bodies to keep each other warm, and to cheat Nature herself of that sustenance for which she would otherwise cry aloud.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1161. Enough has been said to shew the fearful and incalculable deterioration of health, not to say loss of life, consequent upon insufficient water-supply, crowded apartments, close, confined, and unventilated rooms and dwellings, contaminated atmosphere, and exhalations from drains, sewers, and cesspools. It only remains to inculcate, in the strongest and most earnest manner, the necessity for an ample supply of the pure breath of heaven.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1162. If, then, we would enjoy the blessing of health, we must take especial care that there be a free and unrestricted circulation of pure air in and around the dwellings of the whole community, both of the rich and of the poor. There should be no alleys, no courts, no <i>culs-de-sac, </i>no high walls, no interruptions to the movements of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1163. In fine, the true and natural mode of ventilation^ whether in public or private buildings, in dwelling or sleeping rooms, in nurseries, sick chambers, or wards of hospitals, in stables or kennels, is to admit air as freely as light, to give it ingress and egress on all sides, and to allow it to take its own course.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>CLIMATE.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1164. <i>Climate, </i>in its broadest and most extended signification, embraces the nature of the <i>soil, </i>and its <i>cultivation; </i>the <i>elevation </i>and <i>position </i>of a country or, certain locality; the general state of the <i>atmosphere, </i>its purity or contamination; the degree of habitual <i>transparency </i>and <i>serenity </i>of the <i>sky, </i>in connection with the amount of radiation from the ground; the <i>temperature, humidity, prevailing winds, calms, </i>and <i>storms, barometric pressure, </i>and <i>electric tension. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1165. The meteorological phenomena on which the nature of climate depends are more especially connected with the relations of <i>air </i>and <i>moisture. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1166. <i>Heat </i>and <i>moisture </i>are unquestionably the two most important agents which nature employs in producing those various modifications and incessant changes which take place in the lower regions of the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1167. The most poisonous gases, mephitic emanations, malarious, miasmatic, and paludal exhalations, the product of putrefactive changes of <i>organic </i>and <i>vegetable </i>origin, are extricated by the <i>former, </i>and dissolved and retained in the atmosphere by the <i>latter. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1168. These emanations and gaseous products are, as we have already seen, the fruitful sources of all the most formidable and fatal scourges which have depopulated, in various ages, the localities in which they were developed, or the</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>countries to which they were borne by the atmospheric currents.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1169. On the other hand, the equable and genial temperature, the purity, the clearness, the serenity, and tranquillity of the atmosphere exert a powerful influence upon the developement of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, the organic evolution of plants, and the ripening of fruits; and contribute, in no small degree, to the sustentation of health, and the prevention, amelioration, or arrest of disorder and disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1170. Can we then in the selection of our locale overrate the paramount necessity for a due attention to <i>aspect, soil, elevation, temperature, </i>and <i>humidity? </i>But if these considerations be important in health, how much more essential are they in disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1171. Is it of no importance whether the aspect of our dwelling be northern, eastern, southern, or western? whether our habitation be situate on the sea shore, the island, or in the interior of the country; in the city or rural village; on the mountain top or hill side; in the misty vale or open plain; by the tidal river bank, on the borders of the lake, or near the fenny moor? Is it of no moment whether it be sheltered from this wind or exposed to that? or whether certain winds be charged with local impurities and contaminations, or with pestiferous paludal or marsh emanations; whether the country around us be open and bare or close and wooded, in a high state of cultivation or neglected and waste? matters it not whether the air be dry, bleak, tonic, and bracing, or damp, foggy, soft, and relaxing; whether calms, storms, and gales be of frequent occurrence; whether much or little rain fall in the course of the year; whether the temperature of the locality be liable to constant vicissitudes, its mean daily range large or small, or its mean annual temperature that of Madeira, London, or Moscow; whether the soil be of limestone, gravel, sand, chalk, marl, or clay; the water pure, and free from calcareous salts (1233), and its supply ample; or whether the drainage<span class='gtxt_body'>
and sewerage be easy and perfect, or difficult, defective, or impossible?</span></p>

These and many other equally weighty considerations must and ought to obtrude themselves upon our attention in the selection of ground for encampments, sites for barracks, gaols, and union houses, hospitals, colleges, and other public buildings; but individually they embrace much that concerns each of us in the choice of our <i>dwelling, </i>whether with a view to the sustentation of fair average health and vigour of body, or to the improvement of an impaired or diseased frame.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Let us consider each of the preceding conditions separately; and first,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1173. <i>Aspect.</i>&#8212;The ancient physicians attached much importance to aspect. Hippocrates, in the chapter on &quot;<i>Airs, waters, and places,&quot; </i>says, &quot;the inhabitants of towns situate between the summer settings and summer risings of the sun <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>(north) </span>are exposed to cold winds, are well braced and slender; given to excess of eating but not of drinking, and are rather long lived. Pleurisies and acute diseases prevail epidemically, epistaxis in summer, and obstipatio generally. Menstruation is irregular, painful, and in small quantity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1174. &quot;The inhabitants of those towns which are exposed to winds between the summer and winter risings of the sun <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>(east) </span>are likely to be more healthy than those of towns which are turned to the north. The heat and cold are more moderate, and the sun in rising dispels the morning vapours. The inhabitants are well coloured and blooming, and have clear voices. The climate of such towns resembles <i>spring </i>as to moderation between heat and cold. The diseases are few in number, feeble in character, and bear a resemblance to those which prevail in regions exposed to hot winds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1175. &quot;The inhabitants of towns exposed to hot winds, between the wintry rising and the wintry setting of the sun <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>(south), </span>neither eat nor drink much. The women are sickly,</p>

The men are subject to dysentery, diarrhoea, and intermittent fever; in winter to fevers, cutaneuos eruptions, and haemorrhoids. They are not liable to acute diseases, to pleurisies, peripneumonies, or ardent fevers, for such diseases do not prevail where the bowels are loose.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1176. &quot;Townsfacing the <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>West </span>resemble autumnin the changes of the day, inasmuch as the difference between morning and evening is great. The sun does not dissipate the morning mists, and in the latter part of the day the setting sun is scorching. In summer cold breezes blow from the east, and dews fall. The voices of the inhabitants are rough and hoarse, owing to the state of the air, which is generally impure and unwholesome, in consequence of the want of north winds to purify it. The winds and evening breezes are of a very humid character. The situation of such towns must necessarily be very unhealthy.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1177. There cannot for a moment be a question on the subject of aspect. In our island, a residence exposed to the north or east will of necessity be colder than one enjoying a southern or western aspect. The first will never be illumined or warmed by the direct rays of the sun, whilst the south will revel in the enjoyment, even in this country, of a comparatively tropical clime. An eastern, though brighter than a northern aspect, is not so sunny or so agreeable as a southern or western situation. There is no doubt that a southern and a western aspect, especially if combined in the same residence, are those most conducive to health, and best suited to sufferers from disease. These advantages of position will be immensely increased if the locality be protected from the north or east, or from both, by a chain of hills, or by umbrageous forests. A northern or eastern is less genial to rheumatism and pulmonary affections than a southern or western aspect.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1179. The nearer is a place to the sea the less will be the extremes of heat and cold.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1180. The atmosphere of <i>islands </i>and of the <i>sea coasts of continents </i>is more <i>invigorating </i>and more <i>salubrious </i>than that of the interior of continents and inland places, in consequence of the large amount of <i>ozone </i>diffused through it. In temperate latitudes it is <i>warmer </i>than that of the interior of continents, and inland places in the same degree of latitude, in consequence of being subject to a cloudy sky, on which account it loses a smaller quantity of heat, at night, through radiation; and for this reason, also, the atmosphere of islands and of the sea shore is <i>warmer </i>in <i>winter, </i>and <i>cooler </i>in <i>summer, </i>than that of continents and places in the same latitudes far distant from the ocean; and, hence, is of a more equable temperature throughout the entire year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1181. In the <i>torrid zones, </i>however, the temperature of the atmosphere of islands is <i>below </i>that of continents, in consequence of the cooling influence of the waters of the ocean gradually exercised on the winds during their passage over it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1182. The atmosphere of the <i>east </i>coasts of continents, in both hemispheres, unless influenced by oceanic currents running near the shore, is drier, colder, and more bleak than that of the <i>west </i>coasts, which is moister, warmer, and milder.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1184. It need scarcely be remarked that the <i>temperature </i>of the more <i>northern </i>latitudes is colder and less genial than that of the <i>southern </i>latitudes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1185. Of this island, the atmosphere of all places lying to the <i>westward </i>of the meridian of Greenwich, becomes, in the ratio of distance, milder, warmer, softer, and moister. At the Land&#39;s End, the warm vapours of the Atlantic are brought up so constantly and so bountifully by the upper or returning trade winds, that it rains almost daily, the vapours being chilled in the colder regions of our latitudes. Here vegetation luxuriates; the myrtle and the rose live, flourish, and flower in the open air, the year through; and winter is robbed of much of its severity, whilst on the <i>eastern </i>coasts, in consequence of the dryness and lower temperature of the easterly winds, it is felt in all its intensity and bitterness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1186. The <i>rain-fall </i>on the <i>western </i>coasts of England ranges from 30 to 51 inches; and on the <i>south-eastern, </i>the <i>&quot;rainy&quot; </i>point of our island, (558,) from 16 to 24 inches only.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1187. As instances of the superior and very moderate mean temperature of the air of <i>islands </i>in low latitudes, we may adduce that of the Isles of Wight, Jersey, and Madeira, contrasted with that of the Environs of London.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1188. <i>Towns and Cities.</i>&#8212;The atmosphere of all large towns and cities is loaded with the products of combustion, carbonic acid gas, sulphurous and sulphuric acids, sulphate of ammonia, carbonaceous matter, sulphuretted, free, and carburetted hydrogen; contaminated with the impurities, leakage, and imperfect combustion of coal gas; poisoned with the exhalations from the refuse and excrementitial matters from shipping and craft in the docks and navigable rivers, and from the offal, garbage, and putrefying animals cast on their banks, and with the morbific emanations from the waters themselves, saturated and reeking with the filth and blood from slaughter-houses, the excrement of animals, and the sewage of the city itself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1189. These impurities become condensed and entangled in the mist and vapour of the atmosphere, and in the smoke of the city, over which, during the absence of aerial currents, they hover as a.cloud, not merely obscuring the atmosphere, but infecting the inhabitants.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1190. Dr. Macculloch has however suggested that, as malaria &quot;is experimentally decomposed by fire and smoke, it is probable that, amid the unknown mixture which forms the atmosphere of crowded cities, it is actually destroyed.&quot; (954.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1191. Plants are exceedingly sensitive to an atmosphere surcharged with impurities, and suffer and fade and pine away in that of a city loaded with carbonaceous and gaseous matters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1192. The temperature of the atmosphere of cities is superior to, and the mean daily range infinitely less than, that of the country, the thick atmosphere by day offering a screen to the full influence of light and heat, whilst the temperature of the air by night must be raised by contact with the waters of the rivers flowing through it, which it has been shown are from circumstances greatly in excess of that of the minimum temperature of the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1194. The mortality of cities is greatly in excess of that of the country. In the city of London the annual death-rate is 25 in every 1,000, or 1 in every 40 of the inhabitants; but in some of the more dirty and least ventilated parts it amounts to 27 in every 1,000, or 1 in every 37.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1195. According to the Registrar-General&#39;s report for the quarter ending 30th December, 1857, &quot;the mortality in the towns appears to be at the rate of 2 704 per cent &#8212; 27-74 per 1,000; in the country at the rate of 1-926 per cent. = 19-26 per thousand per annum.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1196. The annual standard mortality throughout England and Wales of men, women, and children, placed under the most favourable circumstances of open country thinly-populated, agricultural pursuits, pure air, uncontaminated water, and the absence of the poison of gin palaces, crowded assemblies, &amp;c. has been found by experience, year after year, not to exceed 17 per 1,000.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1197. The excess, therefore, over the &quot; standard mortality&quot; amounts in towns to 10-74, and in the country to 2 26 in every thousand of the inhabitants.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1198. &quot;Is this excess inevitable?&quot; asks the RegistrarGeneral. <i>&quot;</i>This,&quot; he replies, &quot;cannot be admitted for a moment, if we regard only the imperfect state of those sanitary arrangements which the public authorities of London have within their power; neither can it be admitted that the excess of five deaths, or 22 deaths instead of 17, a-year, in every 1,000 living is inevitable in England and Wales, with evidence before our eyes of the same violations of the laws of nature in every district.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1199. &quot;The excess of deaths in England and Wales in 1857, that is, from causes which were for the most part, if not altogether, remediable, was 91,856. Of these unnatural deaths</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1200. &quot;Of the 28,000,000 people who dwell within the shores of these islands, 140,000 die every year unnatural deaths; 280,000 are constantly suffering from actual diseases, which do not prevail in healthy places. The annual number of deaths in the United Kingdom is about 616,000, and the number constantly sick is about twice the number of the annual deaths, or 1,232,000. If the annual rate of mortality per 1,000 were reduced from 22 to 17, the deaths would fall to 476,000, the constantly sick to 952,000.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Too true is it, that &quot;in the matter of health we are all very ignorant or desperately negligent.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1201. Between 20 and 35 years the average annual rate of mortality for the <i>whole country </i>is 9 in every 1,000; in purely country parishes 7 per 1,000; but in large towns and cities it is as high as 12 for every 1,000.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1202. London during the sixteenth century was in a most disgusting and filthy state. In the streets, which were extremely narrow and ill-paved, heaps of the most noisome filth were allowed to accumulate at assigned spots called lay-stalls; the sewers were very imperfect and badly constructed; the buildings were overcrowded, and the inhabitants dirty and uncleanly in their habits. The population lived about twenty years, and 50 died annually out of every 1,000. With a great increase of number the population now lives about 37 years, and the mortality has fallen to 25 in 1,000.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1205. <i>Mountains, hills, and elevated situations. </i>These exercise considerable influence over climate, by the direction in which they lie with respect to the sun&#39;s course, and by their height and the winds which they arrest, or to which they give passage.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1208. As a rule, malaria is rarely met with on hills and elevated situations, unless generated by stagnant pools on the table-land or plateaus of the hills themselves, its great specific gravity precluding its ascent to high grounds.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1213. The reading of the barometer is not so high on hills and mountains as in the plains below. This arises from two causes&#8212;elevation, and the absence of malaria.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1214. Mountain travelling, in consequence of the purity, elasticity, and ozoniferous qualities of the air, is highly conducive to health.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1215. The effect on the pulse and respiration, of mountain travelling, and of the attenuated air of elevated localities, has been already discussed. (763, <i>et seq.) </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1216. From numerous experiments made by M. de Saussure, with the eudiometer, on the atmosphere of the summit of the Buet, of the Great St. Bernard, of the Piton, and of the Voirons, he arrived at the conclusion that the air of these elevated localities is less pure than that of the plains and valleys at their feet. &quot;We may conclude,&quot; says he, &quot;that, in general, the atmosphere at a certain height loses something of its purity.&quot; &quot;And it would appear that if the air of low plains be less salubrious, because it is loaded with heavy exhalations which it sustains by its density, that, on the other hand, that of mountains more than 500 or 600 toises (3,196-85 or 3,836-22 feet) above the sea-level is vitiated by other exhalations, which, possibly lighter than common air, do not the less impair its salubrity. In short, there is a certain medium height in which the density of the air is, all other things being equal, best suited to the life and health of man.&quot; That height he considers to be that of the plains and valleys of Switzerland, situate from between 200 to 300 toises (1,278-74 to 1,918-11 feet) above the sea-level.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1217. Dr. Lombard, in a paper on &quot;<i>Mountain Climates considered in a medical point of view,&quot; </i>has endeavoured to shew that mountain air is as injurious in certain cases as beneficial in others, and that, in selecting a mountain climate for an invalid, due regard must be had to the nature and requirements of the case. He classifies mountain climates under three distinct heads:&#8212;</p>

Dr. Lombard states that phthisis pulmonalis is seen but rarely beyond a height of 1,000 metres <i>above </i>the low valleys or mid-regions of the Alps, and that, at 1,500 metres (=4,921-282 feet) above these, it entirely disappears; and, further, that <i>asthma </i>is peculiar to the <i>highest elevations. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1219. As the frequency of the pulse and of the respiration is in the direct ratio of elevation, (774 <i>et seq.,) </i>it were not only interesting but instructive to inquire the extent to which both would be accelerated by, and also to ascertain the temperature of, that attenuated and colder atmosphere which checks or arrests the developement of phthisis.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1223. The <i>temperature </i>would be diminished at the lower by 16-4&#176;, and at the higher elevation by 21-86&#176; Fah. (90).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1224. Assuming also the average latitude of these low valleys or mid-regions to be 46&#176; 57&#39;, their mean annual temperature will be 55-834&#176; Fah. If from this, 16-4&#176; be deducted, it will give 39-434&#176; for the mean annual temperature of the <i>lower </i>elevation; and if 21-86&#176; be subtracted from 55-834&#176;, it will leave 33-974&#176; as the mean annual temperature of the <i>upper </i>altitude.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1225.&#39; It would therefore appear that phthisis is controlled, arrested, and prevented by an amount of <i>cold </i>almost approaching to freezing point, even though this be associated with an attenuated and ozoniferous atmosphere, productive, as a necessary consequence, of acceleration both of respiration and circulation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1229. M. de Saussure is of opinion that cretinism is not the effect of malaria.&#8212;&quot; On voit des villages cruellement affligees par le cretinisme, sans qu&#39;il existe aucun marais dans leur voisinage, Villeneuve d&#39;Aoste est un example frappant de cette veriteV&#39; At the same time he admits &quot;the possibility, nay, the probability, that the exhalations from marshes situate at the bottom of some of the valleys in which cretins abound may contribute to the production of the disease.&quot; M. de Saussure &quot;believes cretinism to be occasioned by the excessive heat of the solar rays, and consequent stagnation and corruption of the air pent up by the mountains which encircle the deep and close valleys.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1230. Cretinism and goitres abound in valleys &quot;mediocrement elevees,&quot; and are neither seen in the higher valleys nor met with in open and exposed plains.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1231. The inhabitants of wide valleys on the side exposed to the direct influence of the sun&#39;s rays, and to the reflected heat of the rocks above, are more subject to the disease than are those of the villages opposed to the north. The village of Branson, situated at the foot of a rock, exposed to the full south, and consequently liable to a very elevated temperature, abounds with cretins.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1232. Endemic goitre or bronchocele has been commonly attributed to the use of <i>snow-water </i>for drinking and culinary purposes; but the disease is met with where snow is never seen (Sumatra), and is not always met with where snow-water is invariably drank.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1233. The researches, experience, and observation of Messrs. Coindet, Richardson, Manson, M&#39;Clelland, Bally, Inglis, and others, lead to the conclusion that the endemic disease depends on the presence in the <i>water </i>used for culinary and drinking purposes of calcareous salts, the carbonate or sulphate of lime, derived from its contact with limestone rocks, and not upon malaria or the stagnant atmosphere of close, pent-up valleys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1234. Mr. M&#39;Clelland affirms that it is possible to predict <i>a priori, </i>by examination of the rocks of any given locality, whether the inhabitants are affected with, goitre, and that in a survey of 1,000 square miles no instance occurred in which goitre prevailed endemically where the villages were not. situate on or close to limestone rocks.</p>

Valleys and plains on the north side of lofty mountains, being deprived of the warming and cheering rays of the sun, are cold and gloomy, and their vegetation is retarded in a proportionate degree.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1238. Typhus fever is more prevalent in low than in elevated situations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1239. <i>Open plains </i>are liable to winds from all quarters of the compass. <i>Sandy plains </i>are malarious.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1240. <i>Rivers.</i>&#8212;The banks of rivers and adjacent lands are subject to haze, mists, and fogs, the consequence of exhalations and evaporation from the surface of the water (1054). The greater the difference between the temperature of the water and that of the atmosphere, the more dense will be the mist or fog.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1241. In hot climates the banks of rivers are highly pestiferous.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1242. The borders of running streams slowly meandering through low grounds are malarious, unless they be under grain cultivation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1243. The banks of tidal rivers, surcharged with the sewage, offal, and refuse animal and vegetable matter of towns in a state of decomposition, exposed twice during every twenty-four hours by the ocean-tide to the influence of the atmosphere and the heat of the solar rays, are productive of poisonous and mephitic emanations, which engender fever, diarrhoea, and cholera. (945, 1053.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1244. When the temperature of the waters of rivers exceeds 60&#176; Fah. the minimum temperature of the atmosphere being below this, diarrhoea will prevail, and will not subside until the temperature of the water declines below 60&#176;. (985, 1060.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1245. <i>Lakes and lagoons.</i>&#8212;When these retain a considerable depth of water, and when their banks are steep, no malaria is<span class='gtxt_body'>
given off; but if any sensible diminution of the waters occur, or if these retire from their shores, exposing to the solar influence animal and vegetable remains in a state of decomposition and decay, malaria is extricated, and intermittent or remittent fevers are the consequence.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1246. The alluvial tracts at the entrance and exit of the lakes of Switzerland and other countries are sources of malaria.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1247. We read in Pliny that &quot;the putrid lake, Sibache, or Sivache More, is a vast lagoon, covered with water, when an east wind blows, by the waters of the sea of Azof, but at other times is a tract of slime and mud, sending forth pestilential vapours.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1248. <i>Fens and moors.</i>&#8212;These exhale malaria to a fearful extent, and, unless there be ample vegetation in their immediate vicinity or on their own surface to decompose it, the miasma is conveyed by the winds to the dwellings and villages in their neighbourhood, among the inhabitants of which it produces intermittent, remittent, or typhus fevers. Of this we have abundant evidence in the fens of Lincolnshire and the marshes of Essex.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1249. <i>Swampy forests, swamps, if covered with vegetation, </i>and <i>peat bogs, </i>do not produce fever, in consequence of the malarious emanations being absorbed by the leaves of the trees, or decomposed and destroyed by the oxygen exhaled by the foliage, by the vegetation, and by the moss, <i>sphagnum palustre, </i>with which their surfaces are covered, first converted into ozone, or by both combined.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1250. Peat bogs, from the astringency of their water, are inimical to reptile life. Human bodies have been found in these bogs, tanned and preserved from decay by the astringent principle, consequent upon the decomposition, under water, of vegetable fibre.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>by the sun&#39;s rays in their passage through it, but derives its heat by radiation from the earth&#39;s surface, it is self-evident that woods and forests, by excluding the solar rays from the earth, and sheltering the winter&#39;s snow from wind and sun, must materially intercept this operation of nature, and by throwing off large quantities of watery vapour from, and absorbing solar heat by, their leaves, must greatly increase the amount of radiating or cooling superficial surface, and that the combined results must be that <i>wooded countries </i>are <i>much colder </i>than those which are open and cultivated.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1252. &quot;The forests which cover America, and hinder the sunbeams from heating the ground, are a great cause of the temperate climate in the equatorial parts.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1253. It has been often observed in America that lands which were healthy, when covered with wood, have become extremely unhealthy when cleared and cultivated.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1254. It has been already shown (650) that the leaves of plants and trees exhale oxygen, and absorb carbonic acid gas. It has also been suggested that the <i>excess </i>of oxygen so given off, not necessary for the true chemically proportional combination with nitrogen to form or to renew the impaired atmospheric air, becomes associated with the vapour of the atmosphere, and converted by electrical agencies into ozone, or allotropised oxygen (331), the use of which is to decompose or destroy the malaria given off from the earth&#39;s surface (1073). It has also been suggested that the leaves of plants absorb or decompose malaria. (986, et seq.) In either case it would appear that wooded countries, as a rule, if cold are healthy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1255. There is however strong reason to believe that <i>close </i>and <i>wet woods </i>in this country abound with malaria. It has been before shown, on the authority of Dr. Macculloch, (964,) that &quot;malaria is especially united with that transferable substance which forms the foggy stratum, or that the lowest portion</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1256. <i>Drainage and Cultivation.</i>&#8212;Nothing conduces to check the generation and propagation of malaria so much as a <i>high state of cultivation, </i>and a dense population.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1257. Drainage and agricultural improvements of lands have been invariably followed by a rapid and proportionate diminution in the number of cases of remittent and intermittent fevers, the products of malaria.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1258. The <i>breaking up, </i>however, for the first time of <i>pasture lands </i>is attended by the production of malaria and its diseases; and the partial or imperfect draining of a swamp may, by converting it into a wet and noxious meadow, bring it into precisely that state which is peculiarly favourable to the extrication of malaria (982). In low countries the drainage may be sufficient for agricultural purposes, but totally inadequate to the eradication of malaria. The insalubrity may be lessened, but not annihilated.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1259. <i>Meadows, pasture, and grass lands </i>produce malaria; but, if ploughed up for grain cultivation, cease to give out miasmata.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1260. <i>Parks </i>and <i>pleasure grounds </i>ornamented by water produce malaria.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1261. <i>Dryness, humidity, </i>and <i>temperature </i>of the atmosphere. &#8212;The dryness, humidity, and temperature of the atmosphere are intimately associated with and dependant on the point of the compass whence the wind blows, and are as closely connected with, and as influential in controlling the health, disorder, disease, and death of all animal and vegetable creation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1262. The atmosphere of certain localities is peculiarly dry, tonic, bracing, and invigorating, or harsh, bitter, parching, and oppressive. Of the former is that of hills, elevated situations, and gravelly and chalky soils, and of all those places, <i>cwteris paribus, </i>lying to the eastward of the meridian of Greenwich;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1264. <i>Dryness </i>and <i>cold </i>arc the chief characteristics of northerly and easterly winds (535, 542, 549).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1265. A <i>dry </i>atmosphere is not conducive to health. If it be attended with a low temperature it is productive of inflammatory affections of the respiratory apparatus; if with an elevated temperature, it induces fevers, diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera (518). Almost any amount of <i>cold, </i>however, may be supported without any serious ill effect upon the health, if the atmosphere be but <i>dry </i>and the weather perfectly calm (532).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1266. <i>Moisture.</i>&#8212;On the other hand, moisture, if accompanied by a high temperature, is beneficial in its effects upon animal life. <i>Moist </i>and <i>ioarm </i>air is most congenial to a dry and irritable condition of the pulmonary mucous surfaces. If associated with a <i>low temperature </i>it is productive of a vast amount of varied illnesses, <i>inter alia, </i>of bronchitis, rheumatism, erysipelas, mumps, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1267. An atmosphere, saturated or loaded with moisture, interferes with the cutaneous and pulmonary exhalations. The former secretion, instead of evaporating, and relieving the internal heat, pours out, and is condensed in dew drops on the surface, without diminishing the temperature of the body.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1268. The atmosphere of all places in our island lying to the westward of the meridian of Greenwich, soil and local peculiarities excepted, and that of valleys, and of clayey soils, is damp, soft, and relaxing.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1269. It is more than probable that a relation exists between the moisture and temperature of the atmosphere, and the mortality of any given locality or country. <i>Humidity and moderate elevation of temperature conduce to health; moisture, </i>combined with a <i>low temperature induces disorder; </i>a <i>dry atmosphere, </i>even though associated with an <i>elevated temperature, </i>is <i>highly pernicious. </i>(518 et seq.)</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1272. Aqueous vapour has a great affinity for organic matter, and is the means both of preserving and diffusing it. The disagreeable smell arising from drains and accumulations of filth, previous to rain, is to be attributed to this cause. The germ of cholera, for a like reason, pursues and adheres to the course of rivers. In short, the atmosphere is the receptacle for all vapours and impurities arising from evaporation and exhalation. The moister is the atmosphere the more readily are these detected by the olfactory nerves. An infecting or poisonous influence may, however, exist without any smell by</p>

The grasshoppers in the territory of the Locrians <i>sing, </i>but those on the other side are silent; and it is thought probable that this is caused by the region being woody, and their membranes being softened by dew do not produce sound; but those on the Locrian side being sunned, are dry and horny, so that the sound is easily produced in them.&quot; The humidity of the atmosphere of this country so relaxed the vocal organs of Grassini, the celebrated singer, that her voice sunk nearly an octave in pitch, and was changed from a soprano to a contralto. On her return to the drier and more genial clime of Italy, it resumed its former soprano character, and she lost the power of producing the . lower range of notes.</p>

The summer is followed by winter, in which the coldest month reaches the fearful mean temperature of from 0-4&#176; to &#8212;4&#176; Fah.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1281. These variations of temperature depend on two causes, the direct influence of the solar rays, and the radiation of heat from the surface of the soil into the air resting upon it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1282. Soil will absorb and retain more heat than water, especially than running water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1283. To the great ocean which surrounds us we are indebted for the immunity from these extremes which we happily enjoy.

<p class='gtxt_body'>1284. Some of the causes tending to <i>elevate </i>temperature. &quot;The vicinity of western coasts in the temperate zone: continents cut up into numerous peninsulas; deep bays and farpenetrating arms of the sea; the prevalence of southerly and westerly winds on the western confines of a continent in the northern temperate zone; mountain chains which serve as screens against winds from colder countries; absence of forests . on a dry sandy soil; the neighbourhood of .a pelagic stream of running water of a higher temperature than that of the surrounding sea.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1286. Some of the causes tending to <i>depress </i>the mean annual temperature by exciting cold. &quot;Elevation above the level of the sea; the vicinity of an eastern coast in high and middle latitudes; unbroken outline of a continent without deep sea bays; mountain chains whose form and direction prevent the access of warmer winds; extensive forests which hinder the sun&#39;s rays from reaching the ground, and whose leaves&quot; absorb the sun&#39;s rays, and &quot;throw off large quantities of watery vapour, and thus vastly increase the amount of radiating or cooling superficial surface; a misty or overcast summer sky, and a very clear winter&#39;s sky.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1289. <i>Night Air.</i>&#8212;In this country the unwholesome character of the night air is attributed to its coldness. Dr. Wells says, &quot;to our loss of heat by radiation is probably to be attributed a great part of the hurtful effects of the night air.&quot; Descartes is of opinion that these are not owing to dew, but to the descent of certain noxious vapours, which, having been exhaled from the earth during the heat of the day, are afterwards condensed by the cold of the night. For this reason the practice of sleeping with open windows is highly dangerous, but more especially is this the case in malarious districts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1290. It is generally admitted that in all countries the air is coldest about sunrise.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1291. <i>Morning and evening mists formed on low ground </i>are pernicious in their nature, from their holding miasmata in solution. When the former are dissipated by the morning sun, the latter are checked in their progress, possibly in their production.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;No one,&quot; says Dr. Macculloch, &quot;fears a summer evening, or even a mild summer night, unless indeed he find a dew; yet here lies the very danger. A land of meadows, and parks, and ponds, and rivers, and woods is a thousand times more hazardous than all the nights of all the winters that ever were. This is the real night air to bo feared, even tho&#39; the grey mist should not rise, or the dew should not fall. To take a pleasant evening walk by the banks of the river or the lake, to watch the trout rise at the evening flies, to attend the milking of the cows in the green meadow, to saunter among wet groves until the moon rises, listening to the nightingale, these, and more of such rural amusements and delights, arc the true night air/the malaria, and the fever.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1292. <i>Soil.</i>&#8212;<i>&quot;A gravelly soil,&quot; </i>says Dr. Macculloch, &quot; is healthy, because its easy drainage prevents the growth of that particular vegetation which is the cause of malaria.&quot;</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1294. The gravel pits of commons, however, when filled with water, are a very general, and not less unsuspected, cause of ill-health.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1295. Dry and gravelly soils are exempt from typhus fever.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1296. <i>Clay. &quot;</i>A clayey or marley soil is unhealthy, because, by permitting the accumulation and lodgement of superficial water, it generates, how partially soever, those marshy or undrained spots, or wet woods, or moist meadows, which are the sources of malaria, and, consequently, of the various diseases confounded under the vague term unhealthiness.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1297. <i>Stone </i>and <i>sand </i>have little capacity for caloric: they heat or cool, therefore, very rapidly, and to a great degree, and as readily, absorb or permit the percolation of water, which is again extricated by the solar rays in all the intensity and virulence of poisonous miasmata.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1298. The pestiferous nature of stone, limestone, and of sandy plains has been painfully illustrated (1000 to 1007) in the fearful loss which the British army sustained in the Peninsular campaign, and in the Walcheren expedition, when encamped on those soils.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>  CHAPTER VII. <br/>CLIMATE AND DISEASE. <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1301. In the preceding chapters we have considered the atmosphere, the seasons, temperature, rain, winds, pressure, respiration, circulation, infection, contagion, &quot;malaria, ventilation, and climate, and have, as amply as would appear necessary, discussed each subject in all its various bearings upon the sustentation of health, or production of disorder or disease. We have now only to enter upon the consideration of <i>climate </i>in the treatment, amelioration, arrest, or cure of functional derangement and organic disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1302. It must, however, be premised, that the conditions most favourable to <i>health </i>are an average degree of <i>temperature, humidity, pressure, </i>and <i>electric tension, </i>and that any departure from these conditions produces effects proportionate to the amount of such departure.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1303. If this be true in the matter of health, with how much greater force does it apply to disorder and disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1304. Invalids are exceedingly sensitive to changes of the weather. The fluctuations of temperature, humidity,- and pressure affect their delicate organization in a manner and degree which few but themselves can estimate or comprehend, and which are only exceeded by the effect of the variations in the amount and kind of electricity in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1305. Possibly it may be deemed not only not irrelevant to the subject under consideration, but even desirable, to refer, though briefly, to the climate of this country in particular, as well as to those causes on which climate more immediately depends, before proceeding to examine those of other countries<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1306. The climate of this country, as a necessary consequence of the variable winds which blow in our latitudes, is <i>exceedingly changeable; </i>but, notwithstanding this variableness, the difference between the temperature of winter and summer</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>*is, according to Mr. Glaisher, only 20-60&#176;, and to Mr. Howard, 22-9&#176;. (483.) For thus escaping the extremes of heat and cold we are indebted to the surrounding ocean, from which our winds derive their temperature. (1178.) Temperature, it has been already shewn, does not depend solely or entirely on the direct influence of the solar rays. To this <i>small amount </i>of variableness of the climate of our country its inhabitants owe the more robust health which they enjoy, and the greater longevity to which they attain, in comparison with those of the interior of large continents, Russia, for example, in which the difference between the average temperature of winter and summer is as great as 70&#176; or 80&#176;.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1307. The effects of <i>temperature </i>on the general health have been already adverted to (497), and reference has been made to the periodical return of &quot;cold years&quot; and &quot;warm years,&quot; in connection with the recurrence of epidemic disorders. (379, 378.) This periodical invasion of disease is not, however, peculiar to our island; Livy tells us that in 173 years, <i>i.e., </i>from 287 to 460 A.C., nineteen distinct plagues occurred, none of them at longer intervals than <i>seventeen </i>years, and some continuing for two or three years together.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1308. The results of any departure from a due amount of <i>humidity </i>in the atmosphere have been already referred to. (518 to 525, 1269 to 1277.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1309. A high state of the barometric column, as indicative of a <i>dense condition </i>of the atmosphere, is associated with epidemic disease. (634.) <i>Diminished pressure </i>is attended with increased cutaneous exhalation, and, if the fall be rapid, is accompanied witli numerous sudden deaths. (640.)</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1310. It has been stated, on the authority of Mr. Glaisher (255,) and of Mr. Hingeston, (257,) that epidemic or pestilential diseases are associated with an absence or deficiency, and their presence with an increase, in the amount of positive electricity. The latter gentleman believes it &quot;all but incontestable, that what is called negative electricity goes with diseases called asthenic, while the positive belongs to such as are sthenic or inflammatory.&quot; And that &quot;the former is coincident with mild and moist weather; the latter with the cold and frosty, or the hot and dry.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1311. &quot;The kind of electricity is certainly connected with the amount of daylight. There is less light on those days on which the negative electricity prevails, than on the bright, when the electricity is, with few exceptions, positive.&quot; &quot;The public health is seldom favourable when the sky is grey, the air moist,&quot; (the temperature low,) &quot;the daylight diminished, and the electricity negative. On the contrary, it is good when the season is open, the clouds distributed in masses, the moisture condensed into showers, the electricity positive, and the solar rays abundant.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1312. The amount of the annual mean <i>electrical tension </i>of the air for each quarter, and the <i>electric force </i>of each wind, has been recorded under the different &quot;seasons&quot; and &quot;winds.&quot; (390, 412, 433, 538, 598.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1313. It is to be regretted that with regard to the climate of other countries we are not in possession of very many particulars which we require, in order to enable us to form a more accurate judgment of their suitableness, or the reverse, as a residence for invalids labouring under various forms of disorder and disease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1314. Yet, notwithstanding our limited knowledge on these matters, it is generally admitted that the beneficial influence of</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><i>climate </i>in the treatment of disorder or disease of the viscera, of the thoracic and abdominal cavities, is established upon too extended an experience to require or admit of any observation or discussion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1315. There is no climate in the habitable world which is not open to some valid objection; yet in the choice of a residence with a view to the mitigation or arrest of disorder or disease, there is a governing principle to guide and direct us. The constitution of the patient and the nature of the malady itself must be carefully considered and determined before the locality to be selected be decided upon.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1316. As a general rule, shelter and protection for the invalid should be sought from the north-east wind, the mistral, and the gale. A sunny aspect should be chosen, and particular attention paid to temperature, dryness, or humidity both of atmosphere and soil, and especially care should be taken that there be a free circulation of pure air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1317. There can be very little doubt that, in the majority of disorders, an <i>elevated </i>situation possesses many and important advantages over valleys, plains, and low-lands; <i>inter alia, </i>a purer, drier, colder, more bracing, and more ozoniferous air, a greater freedom from fogs and mists; and greater facilities for more perfect drainage.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1318. On the other hand, valleys and plains have their advantages. The former possess a moist, soft, relaxing air, and, possibly, afford shelter from the inclemency of the northerly or easterly blast. The latter are open to the &quot;four winds of heaven,&quot; and revel in the enjoyment of fresh uir, and all the advantages of full and perfect ventilation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1319. The <i>asthmatic, </i>whose malady is bronchitic, cannot bear the stimulus of the life-giving ozone of the hills, though he thrive and enjoy life in the mist and damp of the vale below. The converse of this may also obtain with the subject of this peculiar disorder, in whom a relaxed or congested condition of the mucous membrane of the bronchi exists. He<span class='gtxt_body'>
cannot bear the warmth and moisture of a low position, but will breathe freely under the stimulus of ozone.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1320. The same remark applies to soil; one individual can breathe comfortably only on clay, whilst another can exist only on chalk or gravel.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1321. The subject of a <i>dry tickling cough </i>may find comfort and relief in the greater warmth and moisture of the lowlying, clayey, or marly land; and, on the other hand, may suffer aggravation of his malady by a residence in the colder, drier, and more ozoniferous atmosphere of an elevated locality, or the more bracing air of a gravelly or chalky soil. Again, the subject of a <i>moist or relaxed mucous membrane </i>would flee from a moist atmosphere and clayey soil, and would seek the dry mountain air, or the bracing atmosphere of a chalky soil. In other words, a dry and irritable condition of the mucous lining of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, inducing a dry cough, or cough unaccompanied with expectoration, requires a moist, soft, air, and a clayey or marly soil; and, on the contrary, a moist bronchial membrane needs a dry, tonic, bracing, ozoniferous atmosphere, and a chalky or gravelly soil.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1322. The preceding remarks do not, however, hold good with respect to the mucous surface of the <i>stomach and bowels. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1323. The sympathy which exists between the external skin and the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal is of so sensitive a character, that impressions made on the former are transferred, as it were, by electric influence, to the latter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1324. Dry and cold winds, by constricting the vessels of the surface, check the insensible cutaneous perspiration, and occasion internal congestions, which, in certain delicate individuals, are followed by <i>diarrhcea, </i>or <i>dysentery</i>; whilst, in the same subject, a moist, soft, warm atmosphere, by inducing external perspiration, will occasion constipation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1325. The effects of external impressions on the alimentary canal are attributed by writers to various causes: thus Galen says, <i>&quot;moist </i>weather affects the bowels, and produces belly<span class='gtxt_body'>
fluxes; <i>dry </i>weather, on the contrary, affects the <i>renal </i>organs.&quot; Crampton and Forbes give, as causes of diarrhoea, &quot; <i>cold and wet</i>&quot; impregnated with putrid exhalations; &quot;<i>warm </i>and <i>damp,&quot; </i>and <i>&quot;alternations of temperature,&quot; </i>as <i>hot </i>days and <i>chilly </i>evenings.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1326. The invalid labouring under <i>inflammatory dyspepsia </i>would find relief from the soft, moist, and warm atmosphere of a low-lying locality; and, conversely, aggravation of his complaint from a dry atmosphere and elevated situation; whilst the subject of <i>atonic dyspepsia, obstipatio, </i>or <i>amenorrhea, </i>would be benefited by the latter, and rendered incomparably worse by the former. In every case the demand for food would be lessened in consequence of the increased temperature, whereby the stomach, from diminished exertion, would speedily regain its normal condition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1327. We are told by Professor Johnston, in his <i>&quot;American Notes&quot; </i>that &quot;more than one half of the population of the United States is affected by diseases of the digestive organs,&quot; of whom 14 die out of every 1,000. The mortality under this head in Great Britain is 0<span class="gstxt_sup">-</span>5 in every 1,000. This almost universality of dyspepsia in North America is supposed to depend upon the great extremes, both of <i>temperature </i>and <i>moisture, </i>to which the climate is liable. For five winter months the northern states are ice and snow bound, and in summer are exposed to a burning tropical heat. The east and south-east winds, loaded with the steaming vapours of the gulf-stream, saturate everything with a dripping moisture; whilst the north wind, having passed over the huge continent of land to the north-ward, is so absolutely dry that it parches in summer and blights in winter all animal and vegetable creation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>air, and by the amount of heat given off to the surrounding medium,&quot; it results that the intense cold of the five winter months necessitates a larger consumption of food than can he assimilated with the south or south-east winds. &quot;The temperature of these is too high to admit of active exercise, and consequent accelerated respiration, in order to apportion the waste to the amount of food taken,&quot; and, as in all probability, this is not diminished in the ratio of increased temperature, dyspepsia or disease must ensue.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1329. In functional derangements of internal organs, in congestion of the <i>brain, liver, spleen, and uterus; </i>in <i>Menorrhagia, </i>and in <i>habitual abortion, </i>a soft, relaxing air, by exciting cutaneous perspiration, affords one of the most effectual means of relief. Strangers in Rome suffer from menorrhagia during the winter months, from the dry and cold atmosphere of the &quot;everlasting city.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1330. In <i>rheumatism, </i>climate exercises a powerful influence. Would the subject of this disorder, if left entirely to his own intuitive guidance and devices, select a northern or eastern aspect; would he take up his abode on a clayey soil, in a cold, damp, misty vale; would he locate himself at Pan, where rheumatism springs up indigenous with every blade of grass on the surface of the soil; would he not rather seek a dry, gravelly, and elevated spot, with a southern or western aspect, protected or screened from the bitterness of the north and north-easterly winds; would he not set himself down at Nice, Naples, Rome, or Palermo, and luxuriate in an equable and genial atmosphere?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1331. It is, however, more especially in organic <i>affections of the chest, in threatening and incipient phthisis pulmonalis </i>that climate, if well chosen, offers so many important and substantial advantages. But, on the other hand, if the selection be ill judged, climate may aggravate the disease, may entail much of</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>suffering and distress, or may even accelerate the march and termination of that which it was intended to alleviate or arrest.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1332. <i>Phthisis. </i>Phthisis is supposed to be controlled by <i>cold </i>(1218, 1225) and to be prevented by <i>warmth </i>and <i>marine atmosphere. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1333. The Swedish physicians affirm that the disease becomes less common as we proceed northward, and that &quot;there is such a thing as a preventing action of the polar regions.&quot; In Iceland the disease is stated by Dr. Schleisner to be &quot; unknown,&quot; and in Finmark, in Danish Lapland, to be &quot;never seen.&quot; These views entirely accord with those of Dr. Lombard given above (1218, 1225).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1334. In warm climates the &quot;preventive action&quot; varies with the longitude. In the torrid zones the maximum corresponds to the West India islands, and the minimum to Madras.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1335. Islands and sea coasts, possibly on account of the large amount of ozone with which their atmosphere is charged, and of their more equable temperature, enjoy a comparative amount of immunity from phthisis, which is somewhat remarkable. The American physicians entertain a contrary opinion, and one to which Sir James Clark inclines. In Jersey phthisis is said, by the same writer, &quot;not to be frequent.&quot; &quot;Laennec observed that the proportion of consumptive diseases on the southern coast of Britany was comparatively small.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1336. The mortality from phthisis is infinitely less in the navy than in the army. This, however, may arise from a twofold cause, the greater purity and the higher ozoniferous character of the atmosphere of the ocean compared with that of the land, especially of intertropical climates, and the more severe duties of the soldier contrasted with those of the sailor.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>causes, amounted to 338,979, of which 59,559 were from phthisis, = 1 in 5-69, or 17-57 per cent.: that of London, of the total mortality, 91,565, the deaths from phthisis were 14,562, = 1 in 6&#39;28, or 15-9 per cent.: in Berlin, of the total number of deaths, 73,216, phthisis yielded 12,800, = 1 in 5-72, or 17-48 per cent.: and of Paris, of the total mortality, 85,339, the deaths from phthisis were 15,375, = 1 in 5-55, or 18-02 per cent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1337. In the selection of a residence for the consumptive or pulmonary invalid, <i>temperature </i>is a primary and most important element; <i>moisture, aspect, soil, </i>and <i>elevation </i>are the next considerations.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1338. The temperature of the locality should be, night and day, as nearly equable as possible. The <i>day temperature </i>should be <i>low, </i>that of the <i>night, high, </i>and the <i>mean daily range small. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1339. It has been shewn before, that, as a rule, the climate of islands and of the sea-coast approximates more nearly to these requirements than that of a continent or main land.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1340. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, soft, moist, and genial; the soil clay or marl; but if the disease be attended with <i>copious expectoration, </i>a mild and dry atmosphere and a calcareous soil are demanded. The southern or western shore of a continent, or of an island, exposed to the full influence of the solar rays, and screened or protected by hills and high lands from the asperity of the north and north-east blasts, from the mistral, sirocco, and keen north-west wind, and but little subject to gales of wind, is to be chosen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1341. The localities which have been found most beneficial as a residence by the phthisical patient are Madeira, Malta, Palermo, the islands in the bay of Naples, and Pisa. As a temporary abode, Rome, Torquay, Undercliff, Clifton, Cove, Hastings, and the west cliff of Brighton.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1342. The south coast of England, Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, the peninsula of Britany, and the western coasts of<span class='gtxt_body'>
Normandy, are celebrated for the mildness of their winters, the low temperature and overcast sky of their summers, and the humidity of their atmosphere, and are in consequence suitable for the temporary residence of the phthisical patient, the subject of a dry cough, and of an irritable condition of the lining membrane of the air-tubes. Most of these localities are, however, liable to occasional gales of wind.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1343. Change of climate is of little avail in the advanced stages of consumption. Indeed, it is an act of the grossest cruelty to expatriate the doomed phthisical patient, to tear him away from the family hearth, and separate him, on the verge of the grave, from the bosom of his family, and all its associations, without a shadow of a chance even of amelioration, much less of recovery. It is only in <i>incipient or threatening </i>cases that benefit can be anticipated from change of climate.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1344. Climate is therefore to be looked upon as a <i>preventive, </i>not as a <i>curative </i>means.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1345. As the diseases peculiar to the winter of each locality are, as a rule, cured by the summer, the pulmonic patient should reside abroad, at the least two winters and two summers.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1346. In every functional derangement, and in every organic affection, wheresoever seated, a frequent change of climate is useful.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1347. <i>Phthisis trachealis.</i>&#8212;In <i>phthisis trachealis, </i>and in a dry and irritable condition of the mucous membrane of the larynx and trachea, a warm, soft, humid atmosphere, a clayey &gt; marly soil, a well-sunned southern or south-western aspectj and a low-lying locality, are clearly indicated. Madeira, Malta<span class="gstxt_sub">3</span> Pau, Pisa, Rome, the west and south-west coasts of this island, Devonshire, Undercliff, west side of Brighton, and Cove, have been found pre-eminently useful in these affections.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1348. Patients who are suffering from a dry and irritable condition of the mucous membrane of the air-passages, and who are unfortunately unable to resort to a moist and warm climate, would find great relief from open vessels filled with<span class='gtxt_body'>
hot or even cold water, placed in their dwelling and sleeping apartments, in order to supply by evaporation any deficiency of moisture in the air. The temperature of the rooms should range from 63&#176; to 66&#176; Fah.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1349. <i>Bronchitis.</i>&#8212;In <i>chronic bronchitis, </i>and in a moist condition of the air-passages, a dry, tonic, bracing air, a chalky or gravelly soil, an elevated situation, and a bright sunny aspect, are required, such as are found at Nice, East Cliff Brighton, Malvern Hills, and Clifton.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1350. &quot;<i>Clergyman&#39;s throat.&quot;</i>&#8212;That follicular condition of the mucous membrane of the fauces and larynx to which clergymen as a class are peculiarly subject, and to which the name of <i>&quot;clergyman&#39;s throat&quot; </i>has been applied, is intimately associated with a deranged condition of the alimentary canal and chylopoietic viscera generally, and is not so directly or so immediately benefited by change of air, as by a restoration of the healthy state of the secretions generally, and of the mucous surfaces in particular, and by a strict adherence to a wellchosen and well-regulated diet. A dry tonic bracing air, chalky or gravelly soil, and an elevated locale will be found beneficial. Palermo, Nice, Clifton, or the East Cliff, Brighton, are indicated.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1351. <i>Struma.</i>&#8212;If there be one class of disease in which the salutary influence of climate stands out more prominently and more strikingly than another, it is in the strumous habit. In what form soever struma may shew itself, whether in that of ophthalmia;, coiyza, otorrhoea, tumid lip, glandular enlargements, dyspepsia, sluggish bowels, head-aches, tuberculous deposit, or in affections of the joints or bones, there is nothing to be compared to <i>marine atmosphere, </i>but more particularly to that of a dry and bracing sea-coast town such as Brighton. The atmosphere of soft, moist, relaxing localities, that especially of the west and south-west shores of our island, is, as a general rule, worse than useless in this disease, excepting always n its pulmonary developemcnts, in which class of cases it is to be preferred to that of the dry, tonic, and bracing coast towns,</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1352. As, however, the cure or eradication of this disease is one of <i>time, </i>of <i>years, </i>and not of weeks or of months, a permanent residence on the sea-shore is imperative. How often do we see, time after time, the child labouring under that which is conventionally termed &quot;constitutional debility&quot; taken to the sea-side, under a vain delusion that a fortnight, or at most a month or six weeks of sea-breeze will reinstate his health, and restore the lost bloom to his faded cheeks. This is at best but so much waste of health, to say nothing of money. The disease, week by week, month by month, takes a firmer and a deeper hold, and at last, when possibly too late to prevent disfigurement or mischief, that course is adopted which at the outset would, in all probability, have resulted in restoration to sound and vigorous health, but which now can, at the expiration of years even, end only in disappointment and regrets.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1353. Of the localities in this country which have become the resort of the invalid, or of the pulmonary patient, we may enumerate Hastings, Dover, Brighton, Worthing, Ventnor, Clifton, Torquay, Penzance, and Malvern, and Cove in Ireland; in Franco, Pau and Nice; and in Italy, Pisa, Rome, Naples, and the isles of Capri and Ischia; in Sicily, Palermo; and the islands of Malta and Madeira.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1354. With a few preliminary remarks on some of these places we shall conclude this division of <span class="gstxt_hlt">Hygiene </span>by a table, for the matter of which we are in a great measure indebted to Sir James Clark&#39;s work on climate before referred to, embracing the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the atmosphere of each locality, where recorded; the aspect and soil; the winds which prevail at different periods of the year; those disorders or diseases in the treatment of which each place has been found beneficial, and those in which it has been considered prejudicial.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1355. <i>Hastings </i>claims attention, on account of the shelter it affords from the cold searching northerly and easterly winds, which, so long as the patient remains in the valley of the town, which runs nearly north and south, blow over his head:</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>here, though he feels neither their bitterness nor their intensity, he yet misses the purifying influence of the southerly winds; let him, however, but venture on the tops of the east or west hill, and he will assuredly be driven back for shelter and protection to the town below.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1356. <i>The vale of Hastings, </i>then, from the configuration of the surrounding country, has a climate <i>proper to itself. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1357. <i>Dover. </i>Similar conditions exist at, and the same remarks therefore apply to, Dover.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1358. <i>Brighton. </i>The eastern side of Brighton is situate on a high cliff&quot;, of which the soil is chalk. On the western side, which is a little above the sea-level, the soil is clay. The former is sheltered from the north by the Down*: the latter is open to the winds of this quarter, but is partially screened from the east by the mass of buildings on that side of the town.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1359. The surface drainage and sewerage are unexceptionable, but the sad mistake has been committed of carrying into the sea the whole of the sewage of the town by one outlet, near its centre, by which the purity of the waters for bathing purposes has been more or less sullied, and the atmosphere of that locality loaded with noxious emanations, which, by a southerly wind, are wafted over that portion of the town.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1360. Brighton, during the latter half of February, the whole of March, and first half of April, should be shunned by the pulmonary invalid, on account of the cold, dry, parching east and north-east winds which prevail during the winter quarter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1361. The subjects of congestion of the liver, and of hepatic derangements, would do well to avoid Brighton.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1362. <i>Worthing. </i>The atmosphere of Worthing is softer, moister, and warmer than that of Brighton. The soil is clay and marl. Recent improvements in the drainage and sewerage of the town have made it more healthy than formerly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1363. <i>Underclif. </i>This is an example of soil and elevation<span class='gtxt_body'>
rendering an otherwise soft, warm, and moist situation, dry, tonic, and bracing.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1364. <i>Clifton. </i>The position of this town on the western confines of this island would have ensured for it a soft, warm, humid atmosphere, were it not that its soil, limestone rock, by absorbing all moisture, renders its atmosphere dry and somewhat bracing.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1365. <i>Torquay </i>and <i>Penzance </i>possess all the advantages of extreme warmth and moisture; and the latter place especially enjoys, day and night, an exceedingly equable temperature, in consequence of the vapours and mists from the Atlantic, with which the atmosphere is loaded during the prevailing south and south-westerly winds, precluding the sun&#39;s rays reaching the earth. (582.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1366. The isle of <i>Capri, </i>in the Neapolitan Gulf, is one of the driest climates in the south of Europe. It consists of hard calcareous rock, covered here and there with a rich soil. Malaria is almost unknown on the island. The climate, which is warm during the spring, autumn, and winter, and hot during the summer, has been found particularly useful in rheumatism and in moist bronchial and phthisical affections. The longevity of the natives is perfectly fabulous.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1367. The isle of <i>Ischia, </i>in the bay of Naples, consists of calcareous rock, covered with a fertile soil. The climate, which is very similar to that of Capri, has been found useful in those affections which are relieved by a residence in the latter isle.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1368. Palermo <i>{Felice) </i>is situate on a fertile plain, surrounded by mountains, &quot;the vale of the Golden Shell,&quot; at the head of a bay, five miles deep, on the northern coast of Sicily, screened on the north-west by the rock of Santa Rosalia and the Cape di Gallo, and on the east by Cape Zafferano.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1369. &quot;In a clime which blends the oriental palm and aloe with the orange-tree, the fig, the olive, and the vine: cheered by the brightest sun, refreshed by the purest breeze, and<span class='gtxt_body'>
looking upon the dark blue wave, Palermo is one of the most attractive spots in the world.&quot; This more especially applies to winter, spring, and autumn. The summer is excessively hot, the thermometer, during the day, in June, July, and August, ranging from 80&#176; to 90&#176;, and, if the sirocco blow, reaching to 100&#176;. Cold is unknown in Palermo. In the winter months the temperature rarely falls below 40&#176;.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>1370. The prevailing winds are west and south-west. Refreshing balmy gales from the north occur in winter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1371. Rains of a tropical violence, which continue without intermission for three weeks, set in about the latter end of October or beginning of November, and are succeeded by the <i>second summer, </i>or summer of San Martino. This summer of St. Martin is not peculiar to Palermo, but is common to Italy, Switzerland, and the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1372. Those parts of the city which are built on the site of the ancient port are exposed to malaria during the autumn months.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1373. The atmosphere of Palermo is exceedingly dry, and the sky serene and transparent. The climate is steady and little exposed to gales of wind. In this particular it is infinitely superior to Malta, and is surpassed by no other place in Europe.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1374. Were its advantages of climate more generally known and more properly appreciated, Palermo would deservedly become the favoured resort of invalids, and would speedily cast into the shade many, if not the greater part, of those localities which are now frequented by the pulmonary and the dyspeptic.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>1375. The climate of Palermo will be found useful in phthisisattended with copious expectoration, in chronic bronchitis, bronchitic asthma, atonic dyspepsia, in nervous and relaxed constitutions, in scrofula, and chronic rheumatism; and on the other hand, will be injurious in a dry, irritable condition of the air-passages and bronchi, and in inflammatory dyspepsia.</p>
