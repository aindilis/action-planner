Kate J.'s description:

A "active" manual for living.  It's fluid because it changes according
to your situation at the moment.  One of the words from Glut, fluid
versus fixed formats, a book would be fixed, the internet would be
fluid.

Don't like the idea of something spelling out every little thing I
have to do, it makes me feel inadequate because I shouldn't have to
have it do that.  Kate's objection, according to Kate, is illogical.
Don't want to ask a question, because they will remain ignorant
forever.  Can see the merit.
