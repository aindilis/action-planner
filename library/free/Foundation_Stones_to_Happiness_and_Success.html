<p class='gtxt_body'>HOW does a man begin the building of a house? He first secures a plan of the proposed edifice, and then proceeds to build according to the plan, scrupulously following it in every detail, beginning with the foundation. Should he neglect the beginning&#8212;the beginning on a mathematical plan&#8212;his labor would be wasted, and his building, should it reach completion without tumbling to pieces, would be insecure and worthless. The same law holds good in any important work: the right beginning and first essential is <i>a definite mental plan on which to build. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Nature will have no slipshod work, no slovenliness, and she annihilates confusion, or rather, confusion is in itself annihilated. Order, definiteness, purpose, eternally prevail, and he who in his operations ignores<span class='gtxt_body'>
these mathematical elements at once deprives himself of substantiality, completeness, <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness, </span>and success.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>This </span>is one of the last manuscripts written by James Allen. Like all his works it is eminently practical. He never wrote <i>theories, </i>or for the sake of writing; but he wrote when he had a message, and it became a message <i>only when he had lived it out in his own life, </i>and knew that it was good. Thus he wrote <i>facts, </i>which he had proven by practice.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To live out the teaching of this book faithfully in every detail of life will lead one to more than <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>and success&#8212; even to Blessedness, Satisfaction, and Peace.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='font-size:110%;text-indent:1em;'>Principles</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>IT is wise to know what comes first, and what to do first. To begin anything in the middle or at the end is to make a muddle of it. The athlete who began by breaking the tape would not receive the prize. He must begin by facing the starter and toeing the mark, and even then a good start is important if he is to win. The pupil does not begin with algebra and literature, but with counting and ABC. So in life&#8212;the business men who begin at the bottom, achieve the more enduring success; and the religious men who reach the highest heights of spiritual knowledge and wisdom are they who have stooped to serve a patient apprenticeship to the humbler tasks, and have not scorned the common experiences of humanity, or overlooked the lessons to be learned from them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The first things in a sound life&#8212;and<span class='gtxt_body'>
therefore in <i>a. </i>truly happy and successful life&#8212;are <i>right principles. </i>Without right principles to begin with, there will be wrong practices to follow with, and a bungled and wretched life to end with. All the infinite variety of calculations which tabulate the commerce and science of the world, come out of the ten figures; all the hundreds of thousands of books which constitute the literature of the world, and perpetuate its thought and genius, are built up from the twenty-six letters. The greatest astronomer cannot ignore the ten simple figures. The profoundest man of genius cannot dispense with the twenty-six simple characters. The fundamentals in all things are few and simple ; yet without them there is no knowledge and no achievement. The fundamentals&#8212; the basic principles&#8212;in life, or true living, are also few and simple, and to learn them thoroughly, and study how to apply them to all the details of life, is to avoid confusion, and to secure a substantial founda</span><span class='gtxt_body'>tion for the orderly building up of an invincible character and a permanent success; and to succeed in comprehending those principles in their innumerable ramifications in the labyrinth of conduct, is to become a Master of Life.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The first principles in life are principles of conduct. To name them is easy. As mere words they are on all men&#39;s lips, but as fixed sources of action, admitting of no compromise, few have learned them. In this short talk I will deal with five only of these principles. These five are among the simplest of the root principles of life, but they are those that come nearest to the every-day life, for they touch the artisan, the business man, the householder, the citizen, at every point. Not one of them can be dispensed with but at severe cost, and he who perfects himself in their application will rise superior to many of the troubles and failures of life, and will come into these springs and currents of thought which flow</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA6'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>harmoniously toward the regions of enduring success. First among these principles is&#8212;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Duty. </span>A much-hackneyed word, I know, but it contains a rare jewel for him who will seek it by assiduous application. The principle of duty means strict adherence to one&#39;s own business, and just as strict non-interference in the business of others. The man who is continually instructing others, gratis, how to manage their affairs, is the one who most mismanages his own.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Duty also means undivided attention to the matter in hand, intelligent concentration of the mind on the work to be done; it includes all that is meant by thoroughness, exactness, and efficiency. The details of duties differ with individuals, and each man should know his own duty better than he knows his neighbor&#39;s, and better than his neighbor knows his; but although the working details differ, the principle is al<span class='gtxt_body'>ways the same. Who has mastered the demands of duty?</span></p>

<a class='page'  id='PA7'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Honesty </span>is the next principle. It means not cheating or overcharging another. It involves the absence of all trickery, lying and deception by word, look or gesture. It includes sincerity, the saying what you mean, and the meaning what you say. It scorns cringing policy and shining compliment. It builds up good reputations, and good reputations build up good businesses, and bright joy accompanies well-earned success. Who has scaled the heights of Honesty?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Economy </span>is the third principle. The conservation of one&#39;s financial resources is merely the vestibule leading toward the more spacious chambers of true economy. It means, as well, the husbanding of one&#39;s physical vitality and mental resources. It demands the conservation of energy by the avoidance of enervating self-indulgences and sensual habits. It holds for its fol<span class='gtxt_body'>lower, strength, endurance, vigilance, and capacity to achieve. It bestows great power on him who learns it well. Who has realized in all its force the supreme strength of Economy?</span></p>
</div>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA8'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Liberality </span>follows economy. It is not opposed to it. Only the man of economy can afford to be generous. The spendthrift, whether in money, vitality, or mental energy, wastes so much on his own miserable pleasures as to have none left to bestow upon others. The giving of money is the smallest part of liberality. There is a giving of thoughts, and deeds, and sympathy, the bestowing of good-will, the being generous toward calumniators and opponents. It is a principle that begets a noble, farreaching influence. It brings loving friends and stanch comrades, and is the foe of loneliness and despair. Who has measured the breadth of Liberality?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Self-control </span>is the last of these five principles, yet the most important. Its<span class='gtxt_body'>
neglect is the cause of vast misery, innumerable failures, and tens of thousands of financial, physical, and mental wrecks. Show me the business man who loses his temper with a customer over some trivial matter, and I will show you a man who, by that condition of mind, is doomed to failure. If all men practised even the initial stages of self-control, anger, with its consuming and destroying fire, would be unknown. The lessons of patience, purity, gentleness, kindness and steadfastness which are contained in the principle of self-control, are slowly learned by men, yet until they are truly learned, a man&#39;s character and success are uncertain and insecure. Where is the man who has perfected himself in self-control? Wherever he may be, he is a Master indeed.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The five principles are five practices, five avenues to achievement, and five sources of knowledge. It is an old saying and a good rule that &quot;Practice makes perfect,&quot; and he who would make his own the wisdom which<span class='gtxt_body'>
is inherent in those principles, must not merely have them on his lips, they must be established in his heart. To know them, and receive what they alone can bring, he must <i>do </i>them, and give them out in his actions.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>FROM the five foregoing Right Principles, when they are truly apprehended and practised, will issue <i>Sound Methods. </i>Right principles are manifested in harmonious action, and method is to life what law is to the universe. Everywhere in the universe there is the harmonious adjustment of parts, and it is this symmetry and harmony that reveals a cosmos, as distinguished from chaos. So in human life, the difference between a true life and a false, between one purposeful and effective and one purposeless and weak, is one of method. The false life is an incoherent jumble of thoughts, passions, and actions; the true life is an orderly adjustment of all its parts. It is all the difference between a mass of lumber and a smoothly working efficient machine. A piece of machinery in perfect working order is not only a useful,<span class='gtxt_body'>
but an admirable and attractive thing; but when its parts are all out of gear, and refuse to be readjusted, its usefulness and attractiveness are gone, and it is thrown on the scrap-heap. Likewise a life perfectly adjusted in all its parts so as to achieve the highest point of efficiency, is not only a powerful, but an excellent and beautiful thing; whereas a life confused, inconsistent, discordant, is a deplorable exhibition of wasted energy.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If life is to be truly lived, method must enter into, and regulate, every detail of it, as it enters and regulates every detail of the wondrous universe of which we form a part. One of the distinguishing differences between a wise man and a foolish is, that the wise man pays careful attention to the smallest things, while the foolish man slurs over them, or neglects them altogether. Wisdom consists in maintaining things in their right relations, in keeping all things, the smallest as well as the greatest, in their<span class='gtxt_body'>
proper places and times. To violate order is to produce confusion and discord, and <i>unhappiness </i>is but another name for discord.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The good business man knows that system is three parts of success, and that disorder means failure.

What is a fool but one who thinks carelessly, acts rashly and lives loosely? What is a wise man but one who thinks carefully, acts calmly, and lives consistently 1</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The true method does not end with the orderly arrangement of the material things and external relations of life; this is but its beginning; it enters into the adjustment of the mind&#8212;the discipline of the passions, the elimination and choice of words in speech, the logical arrangement of the thoughts, and the selection of right actions.</p>

Thus the hour of rising is important, and its regularity significant; as also are the time of retiring to rest, and the number of hours given to sleep. Between the regularity and irregularity of meals, and the care and carelessness with which they are eaten, is all the difference between a good and bad digestion (with all that this implies) and an irritable or comfortable frame of mind, with its train of good or bad consequences, for, attaching to these meal-times and meal-ways are matters of both physiological and psychological significance. The due division of hours for business and for play, not confusing the two, the orderly fitting in of all the details of one&#39;s business, times for solitude, for silent thought and for effective action, for eating and for abstinence&#8212;all these things must have their lawful place in the life of him whose &quot;daily round&quot; is to proceed with<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>But this is the end; and he who would reach the end must begin at the beginning.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Slander is akin to lying, but it is even more subtle, as it is frequently associated with indignation, and by assuming more successfully the appearance of truth, it ensnares many who would not tell a deliberate falsehood. For there are two sides to slander&#8212;there is <i>the making or repeating of it, </i>and there is <i>the listening to it and acting upon it. </i>The slanderer would be powerless without a listener. Evil words require an ear that is receptive to evil in which they may fall, before they can flourish; therefore he who listens to a slander, who believes it, and allows himself to be influenced against the person whose character and reputation are defamed, is in the same position as the one who framed or repeated the evil report. The evil-speaker is a positive slanderer; the evil-listener is a passive slan<span class='gtxt_body'>derer. The two are co-operators in the propagation of evil.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Slander is a common vice and a dark and deadly one. An evil report begins in ignorance, and pursues its blind way in darkness. It generally takes its rise in a misunderstanding. Some one feels that he, or she, has been badly treated, and, filled with indignation and resentment, unburdens himself to his friends and others in vehement language, exaggerating the enormity of the supposed offence on account of the feeling of injury by which he is possessed; his listeners, without hearing <i>the other person&#39;s </i>version of what has taken place, and on no other proof than the violent words of an angry man or woman, become cold in their attitude toward the one spoken against, and repeat to others what they have been told, and as such repetition is always more or less inaccurate, a distorted and altogether untrue report is soon passing from mouth to mouth.</p>

Yet its work is only amongst those who have not altogether acquired the virtue of true speech, the cause of which is a truth-loving mind. When one who has not entirely freed himself from repeating or believing an evil report about another, hears of an evil report about himself, his mind becomes aflame with burning resentment, his sleep is broken and his peace of mind is destroyed. He thinks the cause of all his suffering is in the other man and what that man has said about him, and is ignorant of the truth that <i>the root and cause of his suffering lies in his own readiness to believe </i></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>A CONSIDERABLE portion of the happenings of life come to us without any <i>direct </i>choosing on our part, and such happenings are generally regarded as having no relation to our will or character, but as appearing fortuitously, as occurring without a cause. Thus one is spoken of as being &quot;lucky,&quot; and another &quot;unlucky,&quot; the inference being that each has received something which he never earned, never caused. Deeper thought and a clearer insight into life convince us, however, that nothing happens without a cause, and that cause and effect are always related in perfect adjustment and harmony. This being so, every happening directly affecting us is intimately related to our own will and character, is, indeed, an effect justly related to a cause having its seat in our consciousness. In a word, involuntary happenings of life are<span class='gtxt_body'>
the results of our own thoughts and deeds. This, I admit, is not apparent on the surface, but what fundamental law, even in the physical universe, <i>is </i>so apparent?

<p class='gtxt_body'>Each life is a perfectly woven net-work of causes and effects, of efforts (or lack of efforts) and results, and good results can only be reached by initiating good efforts, good causes. The doer of true actions, who pursues sound methods grounded on right principles, will not need to strive and struggle for good results; they will be there as the effects of his righteous rule of life. He will reap the fruit of his own actions and the reaping will be in gladness and peace.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This truth of sowing and reaping in the moral sphere is a simple one, yet men are slow to understand and accept it. We have been told by a Wise One that &quot;the children of darkness are wiser in their day than the children of light,&quot; and who would</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>expect, in the material world, to reap and eat where he had not sown and planted? Or who would expect to reap wheat in the field where he had sown tares, and would fall to weeping and complaining if he did not? Yet this is just what men do in the spiritual field of mind and deed. They do evil, and expect to get from it good, and when the bitter harvesting comes in all its ripened fulness, they fall into despair, and bemoan the hardness and injustice of their lot, usually attributing it to the evil deeds of others, refusing even to admit the possibility of its cause being hidden in themselves, in their own thoughts and deeds. The children of light&#8212;those who are searching for the fundamental principles of right living with a view to making themselves into wise and happy beings&#8212;must train themselves to observe this law of cause and effect in thought, word and deed, as implicitly and obediently as the gardener obeys the law of sowing and reaping. He<span class='gtxt_body'>
does not even question the law; he recognizes and obeys it. When the wisdom which he instinctively practises in his garden, is practised by men in the garden of their minds&#8212;when the law of the sowing of deeds is so fully recognized that it can no longer be doubted or questioned&#8212;then it will be just as faithfully followed by the sowing of those actions which will bring about a reaping of <span class="gstxt_hlt">happiness </span>and well-being for all. As the children of matter obey the laws of matter, so let the children of spirit obey the laws of spirit, for the law of matter and the law of spirit are one; they are but two aspects of one thing; the outworking of one principle in opposite directions.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If we observe right principles or causes, wrong effects cannot possibly accrue. If we pursue sound methods, no shoddy thread can find its way into the web of our life, no rotten brick enter into the building of our character to render it insecure; and if we do<span class='gtxt_body'>
true actions, what but good results can come to pass; for to say that good causes can produce bad effects is to say that nettles can be reaped from a sowing of corn.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>He who orders his life along the moral lines thus briefly enunciated, will attain to such a state of insight and equilibrium as to render him permanently happy and perennially glad; all his efforts will be seasonably planted; all the issues of his life will be good, and though he may not become a millionaire&#8212;as indeed he will have no desire to become such&#8212;he will acquire the gift of peace, and true success will wait upon him as its commanding master.</p>
