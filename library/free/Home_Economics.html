<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>PREFACE</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt"><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>&quot;home </span>economics,&quot; </span>&quot;domestic science,&quot; &quot;domestic economy,&quot; and &quot;household economy&quot; are all terms which are applied to the same science (the management of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home). </span>In Europe, where this subject has received much more attention than in this country, the term &quot;domestic economy&quot; is the one generally employed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_hlt">Home economics </span>covers a vast field, to which nearly all the arts and sciences contribute. Few women have the time to devote to investigation and experiment in all the lines that bear upon the making of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span>In these days of specializing, it would take a large library and much time to cull from the various sources the kinds of knowledge that bear directly upon the making and the management of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span>The aim of this book is to supply such knowledge in a clear, practical, and concise manner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There seems to be a need for a book that deals with the necessities of daily <span class="gstxt_hlt">home </span>life, that teaches the housekeeper the materials and forces with which she has to deal, and the way in which they should be treated. This book has been planned upon this basis. It treats of the conditions which make the soil under the house and in the immediate neighborhood healthful or unhealthful, the changes in water caused by proper and improper conditions, the sources and characteristics of fuels and oils, besides giving careful consideration to the material that enters into the construction and the furnishing of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The chapters on marketing and carving are planned in a novel way, showing by the skeleton the portion of the bone in each cut of meat. Then are given the position and structure of the muscles of the animal, the changed position of the bones and muscles in the hind quarter when the animal is hung, until the final cutting into joints by the butcher, and the cutting into portions by the carver. Any one who will study these two chapters carefully cannot fail to get a clear and practical knowledge of these two important branches of <span class="gstxt_hlt">home economics. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The care of wood finish and of polished floors is becoming more and more a necessary part of the education of the housekeeper. Beautiful floors and finishes are being constantly ruined for lack of proper treatment. The polishing of floors opens a new avenue of employment for careful, intelligent men.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>While there has been no attempt made toward giving receipts for cookery, the chapter on foods will be found to embody the principles underlying all good cookery.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Every statement has been thoroughly tested by the author in the years that she has devoted to the study and experiments which have made this volume possible.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>SIZE AND STYLE OF THE HOUSE</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In planning a building, its special uses must be considered. The house intended for a <span class="gstxt_hlt">home </span>should be made as convenient, sanitary, and attractive as possible. The style of the house depends upon the location. The <i><span class="gstxt_sub">0</span>f </i>location house built in the city or suburbs would, of course, upon style be quite different from that built in the open coun- house, try. The amount of money one is able to devote to the building of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home </span>must largely decide questions of size, architecture, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The simpler the style of architecture, if the lines are good, the more pleasing the effect will be.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sleeping-rooms should never be planned on the first floor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Even in the smallest and cheapest houses there should invariably be a chamber, or open space, between the roof and the story below it. Rooms with no intermediate space between them and the roof are apt to be very much like ovens in the hot weather of summer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Small houses built with low, broken roof-lines are picturesque, but the sleeping-rooms are not likely to be comfortable. Roofs built in such a style, besides being more expensive at the start, are more apt to leak than the plainer ones.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A house built with thick walls will be cool in summer and warm in winter. <span class="gstxt_sup">A</span>of thick?<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Every human being is entitled to some space walls, where he can have absolute privacy for a few hours each day. Houses should be planned to give each person a separate sleeping-room. It is better to have fewer parlors and more bedrooms.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The finish of the walls, ceilings, floors, and all waUsumd woodwork in the house should be as simple as woodwork, possible; then there will be fewer places for dust to lodge and less chance for disease-germs to develop, the expense of building will be lessened, and the work of the housekeeper simplified.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>THE SKELETON AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE HOUSE</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A modern house might be likened to an animal organism, the framework being the skeleton, and the plumbing, flues, heating-pipes, etc., being the circulatory system.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If this part of the house is carefully outlined before any work is done, it will save much time, labor, and expense in the construction of the building. What is of tanceofout- greater consequence, every pipe, flue, and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>lining wire will be placed in the right position and will &quot;&#39;system.<span class="gstxt_sup">17</span> ^<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> surrounded and supported by the proper material. There will be no tearing out of masonry here, or cutting of floors and walls there&#8212;a process of remedying mistakes that often means that heating-pipes are placed in too close contact to woodwork, and that the spaces around plumbing are not properly finished.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When there is a clear mental picture of the completed house, it will be possible to dissect it and leave bare the skeleton and circulatory system. Two sets of plans should then be made, one for the framework, piping, and wiring, and the other for the completed building.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Having decided upon the whole amount of tiveoost^f money to be expended upon the house, allow a foundation, generous portion for the foundation, frame, chim^etef<span class="gstxt_sup">18</span>&#39; <span class="gstxt_sup">nevs</span>, plumbing, heating, and ventilating. Do this even if the finish must be very plain in consequence. No beauty of finish will compensate for a poor foundation, shaky frame, and unsanitary plumbing and heating arrangements.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The second consideration may be the character of the neighborhood, and convenience to business and other interests and pleasures.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Light, sunshine, pure air, and dryness are the most important factors in maintaining the healthful condition of the house, and they should be supplied in abundance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Dampness, coming from the soil under or sur&quot;heaUh*<span class="gstxt_sup">0</span> rounding the house, is a source of danger, giving from soil, rise to consumption, rheumatism, malaria, and kindred maladies.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The nature of the soil on which a house is built is a most important question. The purest soil consists almost wholly of mineral matter intermixed with air and water.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>These poisonous gases are diluted with pure air, and therefore work so slowly in the system that we do not realize the damage that is being done until illness develops. Even then we are ready to attribute the cause to anything rather than to the dampness and poisonous gases that come from cellars, drains, cesspools, swampy land, and decaying animal and vegetable substances in and about our habitations.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All cellars built on clay soil should be drained. The best method of doing this is to dig a trench, slanted slightly, in which earthen pipes, properly joined, should be<span class='gtxt_body'>
laid. These pipes must be covered with at least two feet of clay, well packed.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The floor of the cellar should be constructed with the utmost care. No matter what the soil under the floor may be, there is always danger from the gases which will circulate through it. The covering of the ofceUa&quot; floor should be of some substance that will effectually obstruct the passage of the gases rising from the subsoil.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Many of the best authorities on sanitary questions are of the opinion that a thick bed of clay, well packed, is the very best material for a cellar floor. The one objection to this is that the clay, adhering to the shoes of every one who walks over it, is likely to be carried into other parts of the house. For this reason it is well to have the clay floor covered with a layer of cement.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With the subdrain and the clay floor under the cement, the cellar should be dry and sweet, and, as a consequence, the whole house will be in a good sanitary condition.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>THE FOUNDATION-WALLS</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Next in importance to the soil on which the house is built, and the drainage, come the foundation-walls of the house. They should be so built that there will be no danger of settling because of the instability of the ground. The foundation itself must be constructed in such a manner that there may be no possibility of dampness being drawn into the walls. The subdrain already described will take away the greater part of the moisture from thefoundfthe soil. tion for</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A deep, broad trench should be dug for the cellar walls. The bottom of this should be packed with a thick bed of clay, as was suggested in making the cellar floor. Over this should be put a layer of coarse broken stone, the spaces between the fragments being filled with<span class='gtxt_body'>
crushed stone. The whole surface should be made even, and finally covered with mortar and cement. This foundation will give a solid support for the walls of the cellar.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All cellar walls should be thick. This is essential for the proper support of the house, and, in addition, keeps out heat in summer and frost in winter.

This will insure the thorough lighting and ventilation of the cellar, and the raising of the first floor at least three feet from the ground.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>(note.&#8212;</span>In some parts of the country, as in a number of the Southern States, for instance, the land is so low that cellars are out of the question. In such cases the foundation-timbers of the house rest upon brick or stone piers. The supports are far enough apart to allow thorough ventilation under the house.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>There should be cellar windows on all sides of</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The more smoothly and completely the walls and ceilings of the cellar are finished, the easier they will be to keep clean. The ceilings should be lathed and plastered.</p>

For example, the furnace coal should be as near as possible to the furnace, and the range and grate coal near the stairs.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Every cellar in which there is a furnace should have a cold room partitioned off from the main room.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A good plan for the cold room is as follows: Take one corner of the cellar in which there is a window (two windows would be still better); a northeast or northwest corner is most desirable for this room. Inclose <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Moul^ </span>a square with walls of masonry, leaving a generous opening for the door and a small space for a window which may be opened and closed at will. Divide this room into two parts, using well-joined boards or masonry for the wall, and again leaving generous space for a door. In any case, have strong supports of some kind on which broad slate shelves may rest. If the walls are of masonry, narrow ledges of stone or brick may be arranged to project from them. If wood has been used, broad, smooth, wooden cleats may be fastened to the walls. In the inner room a strong piece of joisting should be fastened firmly across the room and about two feet from the ceiling. Several large meat-hooks may be driven into this joist, on which may be hung joints of meat, hams, poultry, etc. This inner room may be used for storing meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, and all foods that have an odor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the outer cold room milk, butter, and inodorous foods may be kept. These cold rooms should be placed as near as possible to the cellar stairs; if the whole length of the cellar must be traversed to get to them, they will not be used as freely as they should.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A generous sink and ample table-room save much breakage and lighten the labor in the kitchen. The sink should be broad, and the water-faucets should be set well up and back. From my own observation, it seems as if the greater part of the breaking and nicking of dishes is done by striking the articles against the waterfaucets. In a narrow sink the breakage is much oftishM? greater than in a broad one. When it is possible to avoid it, the kitchen sink should not be made of wood. Those made of soapstone, and other kinds of stone, are excellent. Iron sinks are good, except that they rust easily. If wooden sinks must be used, they should be lined with zinc or some other metallic substance. The porcelain-lined sinks are sanitary and easily cared for. The sink should never be inclosed. The waste pipe should be covered with a fairly fine strainer, which should be kept screwed securely in place.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Connecting this pantry with the kitchen, and opening from it, is another pantry, which is a little larger than the first, which contains drawers, closets, and shelves for dishes and such supplies as crackers, sugar, vinegar, oil, and salt, which one likes to have near the dining-room. Here the tableware that must be taken into the kitchen may be kept.</p>

Bricks absorb moisture readily. This is particularly true of a poor quality of brick. Therefore, when bricks are used for the outer walls of a house, only those of the best grade should be employed, and the finished walls should be</p>

In the interior of the house all the wood finish should be protected by varnish, oil, wax, or paint.

The wood for this purpose should be perfectly seasoned, and the boards so The laying well matched that neither dust nor water can finishing pass through the joinings.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>So much depends upon the location, the style of house, furnishing, and mode of living, that a few suggestions are all that can be given on this subject.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The interior finish of the house should be in harmony with the location, style, and furnishing. If the house is exposed to strong light and sunshine, the finish should be soft in tone, and free from strong or pronounced colors. On the other hand, in a city block the light and sunshine do not come into all parts of the house either abundantly or strongly. In such a house the finish should be of a kind that will reflect warmth and light, not absorb it. For somber, sunless rooms and halls the floors, walls, ceilings, and woodwork should be as light and warm in tone as possible. Yellow tones light up a room and give a sense of warmth. Red gives a sense of warmth, but does not brighten a room as yellow does. All shades of green are cold, but</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>the lighter they are the cooler the effect will he. Blue is also cold, but less so than green. Browns are somewhat neutral, but give an impression of warmth rather than cold. Olive greens in which the yellow predominates are soft, warm, and restful colors, which may be used in any light or climate.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The general tone in the finish of rooms that have a northern exposure, or that are not well lighted, should be either in dull reds or yellows.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In finishing the walls of a room, it should always be remembered that they are to serve as a background for pictures, furniture, and hangings.

They should be placed where they will not take up too much wall-space. Sometimes the most desirable part of a room is spoiled by these ugly pipes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>THE CHIMNEY AND FURNACE-PIPES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The first considerations in building a chimney should be safety and the efficiency of the draft.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the accounts of the burning of dwelling-houses, the cause given for the origin of the fire, in a great majority of cases, is a defective flue. This applies to all classes of houses, from the cheapest to the most costly. Certainly in this day materials and workmanship ought to be of so high an order that it would be almost an impossibility to have fires from such a cause.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The draft depends, to some extent, upon location. When Hei lit of p<span class="gstxt_sup">rac</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">caD</span>le, t<span class="gstxt_sup">ne</span> chimney should be carried high chimney, enough for the top to be free from all obstruction.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A chimney whose top is overshadowed on one or more sides by high walls will not draw when the wind is in certain directions.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In building fireplaces, every precaution should be taken to preclude all danger of the woodwork taking fire. This may be accomplished by surrounding them with thick walls of brick or other masonry. Deep fireplaces do not heat a room as well as shallow ones, except at the explaces, pense of a great deal of fuel. Unless one lives in the country, where wood is cheap, the fireplace should not be very large. The back should slant forward as it rises; this tends to throw the heat into the room.<span class='gtxt_body'>
Every fireplace should be provided with a damper that may be opened or closed at will. The best finish for the interior is fire-brick. A facing and hearth of glazed tiles is desirable, as they are clean and reflect the heat.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Hot-air pipes, when passing through walls or floors, should be several inches from the woodwork. If such openings can be plastered, or the pipes wrapped <span class="gstxt_sup">S</span>J^<span class="gstxt_sub">1</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">fe</span>&quot; in asbestos, the danger of fire from this cause will be greatly diminished. Use every precaution here.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE PLUMBING</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The plumbing of the house should be of the best quality, as simple as possible in construction, and there should be no more of it than is actually necessary for the comfort and convenience of the family. Stationary basins with hot and cold water in the bedrooms, and bath-rooms connected with sleeping-rooms, lighten the labor of <span class="gstxt_sup">Bt</span>^^<span class="gstxt_sup">ry</span> those doing the work of the household, and they are a great luxury; but they are dangerous things to have in or next to sleeping-rooms. It is better to have bathrooms as far away from sleeping-rooms as possible, and to put generous, portable wash-stands and bowls in the sleepingrooms.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There should be the least possible horizontal piping laid in the house. Hence, bath-rooms, closets, etc., should be placed, when practicable, in locations on the different floors that are relatively the same. All <span class="gstxt_sup">H</span>pTM^<span class="gstxt_sup">al</span> plumbing should be in sight, and the traps so placed that they may be opened and examined with ease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The trapping is one of the most important constructions in plumbing, and only traps of the simplest form should be used. A trap is a U-shaped bend in a use? pipe. It must always contain a sufficient quantity of water to extend an inch or more above the bend. This<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Each water-closet should be provided with a separate flushing-tank which will hold at least three gallons of water.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In communities where there are no water or sewerage systems, the problem of the disposal of the sewage is a serious one; but it should not be neglected or ignored, as is often the case. Owing to the habit, prevalent in many country places, of throwing all the slop-water of the household upon the ground near the dwelling itself, poisonous gases are constantly being diffused, and the poison also filters through the earth from these points of deposit into the wells. I suppose it is no exaggeration to say that one half of the people living in country places suffer from impaired health on this account.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Earth has great purifying power. The dirtiest water, after filtering through a large area of earth, <span class="gstxt_sup">E</span>ptuiaer * becomes comparatively pure. It takes time, how* ever, to accomplish this. All dirty water should be carried as far as possible from the house.

The trench should be filled in with clay. The outlet of this drain may be on a piece of land distant from the house at least two hundred feet. Every particle of liquid refuse must go into this drain. When it is not possible to have a water-closet, an earthcloset should be constructed, with care to have dosets. <span class="gstxt_sup">as</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">sam</span>tary as such things can be made. Each member of the household should be taught how to use the earth, and the necessity of keeping the earthcloset dry.</p>

The board that shuts in the vault must be so arranged that it can be easily removed, and it should have two openings cut in it for ventilation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The contents of the vault must be kept covered with fine, dry earth. If, the earth is mixed with powdered charcoal, so much the better. A box of this mixture, and a small shovel, should be kept in the closet. The vault will have to be cleaned frequently. Chloride of lime, or quicklime, might be scattered in the vault occasionally. No liquid should ever be poured into the closet. The secret of keeping it in a sanitary condition consists in keeping it <i>dry, </i>and sprinkling in dry earth every time it is used.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>That which flows <i>over </i>the soil carries with it portions of the loose matter which it encounters in its rush to stream or pond. The water that sinks into the soil filters until it reaches well, spring, or subterranean stream.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In its passage through the soil it may, and usually does, undergo many changes, all depending on what it finds in its travels.</p>

When the water-supply comes from wells or springs near a habitation, there is always a possibility of pollution, unless the surrounding soil is guarded with greatest care. All refuse, dry or liquid, from houses, barns, and outhouses, if left where it can soak into the soil, will, if the spring or well is near enough, find its way into the water. This almost invariably means disease, and very often death.</p>

Iron, phosphates, etc., are also found in water, according to the locality over which it flows. Air and carbonic-acid gas are always constituents of pure water.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All natural waters have dissolved in them carbon dioxid, oxygen, and nitrogen. Water absorbs about its own volume of carbon dioxid, about one ^^JJJjJT twenty-fifth of its own volume of oxygen, and dioxid. a much smaller quantity of nitrogen. These gases give life, sparkle, and a su^gestiojtv.of flavor to water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Carbon dioxid has the property of dissolving lime. As the water charged with this gas flows over the beds of limestone and sulphate of lime (gypsum), it dissolves particles of the lime which is held in solution by the carbon dioxid, thus giving to the water the quality we call hardness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. There are two kinds of hardness&#8212;temporary and permanent.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Temporary hardness is due to carbonates. Water flowing over a limestone district dissolves small portions of the lime which is held in solution by the carbonic acid in the water. Now, if the carbonic acid be removed or given something else to work upon, the lime in the water is precipitated. We see this when we boil water and a white crust is found on the vessel in which it was boiled. In Paris, a thick coat covers the interior of the vessel in which water is boiled in a day or two; even the cover of the saucepan will contain a coating of lime where the steam has condensed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. When water is boiled f*.. <i>some </i>time the carbonic-acid gas is driven off, and there is nothing to hold the lime in solution, so it drops out of the water. But this gas gives life to water, and by long boiling we lose this, and, naturally, as a beverage it is flat and unpalatable, and the beverages which we make from it are not so bright as those made with water which has been freshly boiled.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the water is poured several times from one vessel to another, it will reabsorb some of the gases, and the flavor will be improved.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>One of the best methods of removing temporary hardness (that due to the carbonates) is what is known as Clark,s process. One tenth of lime-water is added to the teinporary hard water&#8212;that is, one gallon of lime-water to hardness, every ten gallons of hard water. (See &quot;LimeWater.&quot;)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Removing When the hardness is permanent it is softened hardness<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span>* <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>dditio<span class="gstxt_sup">n</span> of sal-soda. However, enough of</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>this chemical cannot be used to soften the water employed for cooking purposes, but it is valuable as an agent for softening the water employed in washing and cleaning.</p>

Alum, oak chips, and certain lationT kinds of nuts have the property of coagulating albuminous matter, and the precipitate carries down other impurities.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Water taken from marshy land, ponds, or rivers, in which decaying organic substances are dissolved, should be purified by the addition of oak chips or alum. When the water becomes clear it should be filtered or strained. Use about eight grains of alum to a gallon of water; if the oak chips are used, a handful to about two gallons of water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When a filter is not employed in the kitchen, all the water used for drinking and cooking may be strained through a flannel bag&#8212;small bags with running-strings, which may be fastened on the faucet. They should be changed every day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>TESTS FOR IMPURITIES IN WATER</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Church gives the following simple tests, which may be made in any kitchen, for impurities in water:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;Boil one quart of the water to be tested ration.<span class="gstxt_sup">0</span>&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">m</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> porcelain dish, and then heat the dry residue hotter and hotter. If the original residue is white and powdery in appearance, that is, so far, a good<span class='gtxt_body'>
sign; but if it is partly white and partly yellowish or greenish, and especially if there are gum-like stains around the residue, then, on heating these parts of the residue, we shall probably see them darken, fuse, and burn away in part, giving out fumes having a disagreeable smell. If the blackening is considerable, much organic matter is present; but if the smell is offensive (like burnt feathers), then it is certain that the organic matter is of animal origin, and is, therefore, more likely to be unwholesome, or even poisonous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;If water contains substances derived from the decay of</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>animal or vegetable matters, such as those in sewage and</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>tiful purple color of a chemical substance called of potash, permanganate of potash. The reason for this is as follows: The decaying organic matter of the water attracts oxygen strongly when it is presented in certain states or forms. Now, a solution of the above permanganate contains much oxygen just in the right state to be attracted and removed. By its removal from the permanganate the composition of that substance is altered and its color destroyed. The more organic matter in the water, the more permanganate will be decolorized. The test may be thus applied: Fill a clean white tea-cup with the water to be tested. Add about sixty drops of weak sulphuric acid; stir with a clean slip of window-glass. Now pour in enough of a weak solution of permanganate of potash to render the water a rich rose-color. Cover the cup with a clean glass plate. Now, if there be much organic matter in the water, the color will go in a few minutes, and more permanganate may be added, and still lose its color. It must be recollected, in using this test, that peaty matter and iron salts, which are not necessarily unwholesome, give the same results.&quot; &quot;Nearly fill a clean tumbler with water, and then add<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>cloudiness, if there is a solid curdy substance found, then there is too much common <i>salt </i>in the water. It may be said, What harm is there in common salt? We answer, None in the common salt as such, but only in common salt as evidence of some kinds of pollution. We will explain. Common salt (chloride of sodium) does not occur in rain-water or pure well-water, except to the extent of a little over a grain per gallon. Of course there is more in waters from salt-bearing rocks and in waters near the sea. But generally,&#8212;at all events, in a chalk or limestone district,&#8212;where common salt is found in any quantity exceeding one and one half grains per gallon, which gives a mere cloudiness with nitrate of silver, the salt is derived from sewage&#8212;in other words, from the salt consumed in human food and voided chiefly with the urine. If a water be found to contain both organic matter and common salt, it is probably contaminated by house or town sewage. If organic matter be abundant, but accompanied by a smaller quantity of common salt, then the source of pollution is rather the excrement of farm animals than of man, or it may arise merely from vegetable refuse.&quot;</p>

The beginners in housekeeping should, first of all, decide upon the amount of money they can afford to spend in furnishing; next they should make a list of the essentials; then another list of desirable accessories should be made out; finally, they should agree to buy the essentials first, to have them of as good material and workmanship as can be afforded, and to select form and colors that will be simple and quiet rather than elaborate and striking.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is hardly possible to estimate the influence that the furnishing of a room has upon the feelings and character of the inmates.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Every article in a room should have a reason for being there. The thing that supports real weight or pressure should have the appearance of being able to do so without any strain upon itself or danger to the object supported.<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is the hall that gives the first impression of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the size of the hall will permit, it is best to furnish it as a reception-room. In that case, a table, chairs, hall-settle or a plain sofa, mirror, pictures, and, if there is room, a small bookcase, will make a comfortable and charming room. A fireplace usually includes a mantel-shelf on which some ornaments may be arranged. A clock is always appropriate in a hall. The floor, if possible, should be of hard wood, and rugs may be laid on it here and there.</p>

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The floor of this room should be of hard wood. The table and chairs must be well made and of generous size. It is impossible to arrange a narrow table in an elegant manner, and nothing is more uncomforta- <span class="gstxt_sup">r</span>^^<span class="gstxt_sub">s</span>^&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">d</span> ble than small, unsubstantial dining-room chairs. ingB. When the sideboard is built into the side of the room, the table and chairs will be all the necessary furniture. If there is no sideboard, and the expense of one cannot be incurred, a sideboard-table, which may be covered with a pretty cloth, will do to hold the odd bits of tableware one always wants in the dining-room. A mantelpiece and one or two cupboards give an opportunity of displaying pretty bits of porcelain and glass to the best advantage. Nothing one may put in the dining-room will add such brightness and charm as closets or cabinets, through the glass doors of which the brilliant glass and china may be seen. Growing plants and pictures are always a pleasing addition to this room, which should be one of the pleasantest in the house.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The ideal library is a room in a quiet corner of the house, with bookcases built around the walls, not too high, so that the titles of the books may be read by a person standing on the floor. As wall-space is of great library, value in this room, there should be only one large window. The principal light should come from windows above the bookcases. The floor should be of polished wood, and the walls painted or papered in rich, warm colors. An open fireplace, a library table of generous size, a desk, comfortable chairs, a window-seat, a couch with pillows, rugs,<span class='gtxt_body'>
etc., all should find a place in this room. It will be made doubly attractive and instructive if there are some classical pictures and a few casts. The whole atmosphere of a library should suggest thought and study.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE LIVING-ROOM</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In every house there is one room in particular where the members of the family assemble in their hours of leisure. This room is known as the living-room or sitting-room. In many homes it combines parlor or drawing-room, sittingroom, library, and reception-room. When this is the case it is apt to be an exceptionally delightful place; in any case, it ought to be the most attractive room in the house.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Here there should be the best light, the greatest amount of sunshine, the most pleasing and refining pictures, the easiest chairs, the most cheerful fire, and books, statutes&#39;&quot; tables, foot-rests, etc. In a room of this kind comfort in there should be a large center-table, with a good <span class="gstxt_sup">tt</span> room!<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span>* l<span class="gstxt_sup">am</span>p <span class="gstxt_sup">or</span> drop-light. If the family is large, one or two smaller tables, on which student-lamps are placed, will be of the greatest comfort. Even if there is a library, this room must have a bookcase filled with miscellaneous literature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A closet where newspapers, magazines, games, work, etc., may be kept will be found a great convenience. If there is no closet, some arrangement should be made for keeping these things. One so often wants to refer to back numbers of papers or magazines that these periodicals should be kept in an accessible place for a certain length of time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Another convenience in such a room is the box-seat. Any room used as much as this is sure to be should have a polished floor, and there should be a generous supply of rugs. All the furnishing should be of the most substantial and comfortable kind, with nothing too good for constant wear<span class='gtxt_body'>
and exposure to light and sunshine. Anything that has to be protected by scarfs or tidies is out of place here. Wellmade ratan chairs, cushioned in seat and back, are light, clean, and comfortable. tial ftrnd</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It seems a pity that so many people still cling ture in the to the rocking-chair. It takes up a great deal of roonf&quot; space, and the rockers are always in the way, and are continually being pushed against furniture and baseboards, where they often do much damage. The half-reclining position which is the inevitable attitude assumed in this chair is not graceful, nor is it comfortable if one wishes to work or read. Besides, many people become inexpressibly nervous when they are in the same room with a person who is constantly rocking.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A parlor should be elegant and dainty. The tints of walls, ceilings, and carpets should harmonize and be in delicate tones. The furniture should be light and elegant, the draperies rich, and pictures and ornaments good, even if that means very few of them. Really, unless one has a large establishment, it is best to omit the parlor. Its place may be supplied by a small reception-room, daintily furnished. The money that would be expended on the parlor may be used to far better advantage in the living-room, library, and other parts of the house.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE BEDROOMS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The furnishing of these rooms is as important as that of any other part of the house. It is in the sleeping-room that one must get an interval of that absolute physical and mental rest which every human being requires during the twenty-four hours of each day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In sickness or health, there is no food or medicine that has such an influence on the physical and mental condition as restful slumber. Not one person in fifty reof<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span>heait^ alizes the great importance of favorable condiful sleep, tions for healthful sleep.

Rugs, large or small, that bedrooms, may be shaken and aired frequently in the open air, may be used to give a look of warmth and comfort that one likes in winter in our northern climate. Woolen stuffs absorb dust and odors, and they should not be used if they cannot be subjected to frequent dusting and airing.</p>

In addition to these things, if there is space and one can afford the extra outlay, a couch with a few pillows is a most. desirable bedroom, piece of furniture. A large mat of Japanese matting, or a Japanese cotton rug, should be placed in front of the wash-stand, whether the floor is polished or covered with matting. Another piece of furniture that will be of great service is a large screen. This may be used at night to prevent the wind from blowing directly on the sleeper, and in the daytime to shut off the corner where the toilet arrangements are kept. Of course the room will be all the more charming and convenient if there are pictures, a few . book-shelves, and a writing-desk. Such a room may be kept in an absolutely sanitary condition with very little work.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Nothing could be simpler or more sanitary than the iron or brass bed, with the woven-wire springs fastened to an iron frame. The only objection to the woven wire is that it is apt to sag&#8212;an almost unpardonable fault in a bed. But when the wire is of extra good quality, closely and firmly woven, and attached to an iron frame, it makes an excellent foundation for a single bed. If a thick, well-made mattress is placed on this, the bed will be very comfortable. The best arrangement, however, is to have a</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>rather hard mattress, of excelsior, for example, treisBs. <span class="gstxt_sup">w</span>^h <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> good hair mattress on top. This gives a</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>bed that will sustain the body at every point of contact, and which will be soft without yielding. Everything else being equal, one should get perfect rest on such a bed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It may be thought that two hair mattresses would be better than one hard one and one of hair, but this is not the case. I am convinced that half the unrest, sleeplessness, and backache with which people are afflicted is due to the fact that most of the beds in use do not support the body in a perfectly horizontal position. Heavy people are the greatest sufferers, for the middle of the body sinks into the yielding bed, and is at an angle where it should be straight so as to give perfect freedom to the internal organs. If one cannot afford hair or wool mattresses the excelsior mattress may be made more comfortable by laying a thick pad upon it. The pad may be made like a comfortable, of cotton-bat&#187; ting, covered with white cotton cloth. It should be as wide and as long as the mattress and quite thick.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>People who have been accustomed to a very soft bed may object, at first, to a support that yields only slightly; but once having given it a thorough test, they will never be willing to sleep on any other kind of bed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Teach the children to sleep on a firm bed, and with only the thinnest kind of a pillow, if any, under the head.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The question of pillows is an important one also. It is difficult to induce one who has acquired the habit of sleeping on high pillows to change to low ones. But the children reason for making such a change is based on a should be hygienic principle. When one is bolstered up in bed it is impossible to relax all the muscles, a an almost thing which can only be done when the head is ^^JJ^ almost on a level with the rest of the body. One position, should gradually accustom himself to sleeping ^ with the head low. The pillows may be lowered a little each week until the desired point is reached.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The length of the bed and the length of the sheets are two important factors in the comfort&#8212;or discomfort&#8212;of the sleeper. The measurement of the bed on the <span class="gstxt_sub">L</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">ft</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">of</span> inside should not be less than seventy-eight inches. sheets of The finished sheet should measure at least two and three quarter yards. This will admit of the sheet being tucked well under the bottom of the mattress, and of there being enough at the top to turn back and prevent the blankets from coming in contact with the face and hands.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Some housekeepers are particular in this respect with all the beds except those occupied by the servants, to whom they give sheets of the smallest possible dimensions. It should be remembered that the generous sheet adds not only to the comfort of the sleeper, but that it also is a protection to the bedding.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Coverings should be as light as possible, and of a material that will insure ventilation. There is nothing better than the washable woolen blankets.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A word as to the quality of the blankets. There is no question but that the all-wool blanket, being warmer and Blankets lighter, is more desirable than one of cotton or of wool. The only advantage of a mixture of cotton and wool is that the blanket does not shrink so much in the washing; but if the work is properly done there need be no perceptible shrinkage in the woolen ones.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are blankets that are so fine and costly that one hesitates to have them washed, or even cleaned, often. Such blankets are generally protected by a cotton or linen cover, and can be used a long time without cleaning. But even if these blankets do not become soiled, after a while they will have absorbed impurities from the body, and they should have frequent and thorough airings. The better plan is to have less costly coverings, that may be washed at least once a year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The making of the bed is quite as important as any other matter connected with it. Everything possible should be <span class="gstxt_sub">r</span> done to prevent discomfort and restraint. In the tance of a following directions, it is the sleeper who is con</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_sup">we</span>bea<span class="gstxt_sup">ade</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">sidere&lt;j</span>, <span class="gstxt_sup">and</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">not</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">the</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">st</span>y<span class="gstxt_sup">le</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">of</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">tne</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">bed</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Spread the under sheet on the mattress,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>getting it perfectly smooth. Tuck it in all around.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Spread the top sheet on smoothly, having enough to</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>tuck in generously at the foot. After tucking the sheet</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>under the foot of the mattress, pull it down a</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>make^ li^le from the top, that it may not be too tight</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>bed. over the feet of the sleeper.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Put the blankets on, having <i>the first </i>one come</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>well down over the end of the mattress; lay the others even</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>with the end of the mattress. If the blankets are double, see</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>that the open end is toward the head of the bed, so that</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>half of the blanket may be turned back if one wishes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Tuck the top sheet and the blankets in at the <i>side </i>of</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the mattress, not <i>under </i>it. This leaves the covering free.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Put on the pillows and spread. How this shall be done depends upon the mistress of the house. Taste and fashion vary in these matters constantly, and they are of no vital importance. Still, system and care are essential, that the bed may look neat and attractive.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The mattresses should be protected by large cases of</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>bleached or unbleached cotton cloth. Wide cotton should</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>be procured for this. In measuring for the width</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>of the case, allow for the width and the depth of Protection</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'><i><span class="gstxt_sup">r</span> </i>and care of</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>the mattress; m measuring for the length of the mattress, case, allow for the length and the depth of the mattress. Thus, if your mattress is seventy-six inches long, forty inches wide, and eight inches deep, you will require five yards of cloth fifty inches wide. This allows for the seams in making, and for some slight shrinkage. Fold the cloth together, and stitch it, leaving one side open. Slip the mattress in at the open side, and sew it up. This sewing may be like strong basting; for the covers should be taken off and washed twice a year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The mattresses for a double bed should be in such a form that the wear may come on all parts equally. For this reason it is a good plan to have the mattress made in two parts, one a square and the other an oblong. The oblong should be as long as the square, of course, and wide enough to fill the space between the edge of the square and the foot of the bedstead. If the square is turned about from day to day, and the oblong piece is sometimes at the foot and sometimes at the head, the wear on all parts of the mattress will be equalized.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The one objection that may be raised to this arrangement is that the seam where the two pieces come together is sometimes annoying. To obviate this, a thin comfortable, made of cotton-batting and white cotton cloth, may be spread over the mattress.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the springs are not covered, there should be a covering<span class='gtxt_body'>
of some washable material&#8212;strong unbleached cloth, for example. Springs that are of a style that will admit of</span></p>

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>So much of the health and comfort of the family depends on the kitchen that the most careful thought should be given to its furnishing.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>First in importance is the range. As far as cooking appliances are concerned, we are now in a transition stage.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>With the exception of some localities far back in cooking <span class="gstxt_sup">coun</span>t<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span>y where it is still used, wood as a fuel</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Anthracite coal takes its place in some parts of the country, and bituminous coal in others. For the last twenty years gas as a fuel for cooking purposes has been growing in favor. Various forms of petroleum are also used. Electricity is now preparing to enter the field as a powerful rival of all the other fuels. The costliness of the cooking apparatus which it requires seems to be the only obstacle in the way of its speedy adoption. This objection will, no doubt,<span class='gtxt_body'>
be eliminated in time. Certainly, for the great majority of householders, coal will be the fuel for a long time to come.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. That it is possible to make the oven as <i>hot </i>on the <i>bottom </i>as on the top.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. That there shall be a good arrangement for broiling.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. That the fire-box shall be large enough to take in sufficient coal for the work to be done without being filled to the top.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. That a large part of the top surface of the range may be made hot enough for the boiling of liquids.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>8. That the grate shall be of a kind that will admit of the bottom of the fire being cleaned without the use of a poker. (The Dokash and Duplex grates are both excellent.)</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If a gas-range is to be used, see that the oven accommodations are ample, that there is a good place for broiling, and that there is room enough on the top of the range for boiling, stewing, frying, etc. Be sure that there is <span class="gstxt_sub">ra</span>ngts. one small burner, or even more, for simmering.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The gas-range should have a small pipe entering the chimney to carry off the products of combustion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The pipe which supplies the gas to the range should be of iron, and large enough to insure a sufficient flow of gas when all the burners are in operation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Ample table-room in the kitchen simplifies the work. The tables should be strong and well made. A white table is very attractive, but it means a great deal of care. If the<span class='gtxt_body'>
table is covered with white enameled cloth, it will always look well, and it may be kept clean with little labor, provided hot dishes are not placed on it.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The number of cooking utensils, and the most desirable materials for them, are difficult questions for the housekeeper to decide at any time; but to the beginner they Ja&quot; have an added importance, as the drain on the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>en utensils, purse must usually be considered. It is a mistake to fill the kitchen with all the utensils one may think she will be apt to need in the future. It is wiser to get the necessary articles first, and to have them of the best quality and the simplest construction. Utensils with the smoothest possible surface, and no more coils or grooves than are absolutely necessary, are the easiest to keep clean, and will be found to last the longest, and are therefore an economy in time and money.</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA49'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are several qualifications that are desirable in a cooking utensil:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Smoothness. Desirable</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Imperviousness to the absorption of grease or flavors.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Inability to impart flavor to, or to discolor, food substances.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are not many materials that combine all these qualifications. Iron and steel are desirable materials because they can sustain a high temperature without in- ^ <i><span class="gstxt_sub">jxm</span> </i>jury, and if properly cared for they grow smoother and steel and finer with use. For these reasons iron is the &quot;^j&#174;&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span>&#39; most satisfactory metal for the following articles: frying-kettles, frying-pans, omelet-pans, waffle-irons, etc. Iron utensils should not be used for cooking fruits, or similar articles into which acids enter, as they will discolor the preparation and spoil the flavor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The various kinds of granite or enameled ware, if ^^J<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> &#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span> of the first grade, are generally very satisfactory. ware<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> The surface is smooth and the utensils are light.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tinware is most useful for certain purposes. It must be remembered that this metal melts at a rather low temperature, <i>i. e., </i>442&#176; F., and it should never be exposed Tulare to a high temperature, such as is necessary, for example, in frying; nor should it be placed over the fire or in the oven without being covered with water, or some liquid in which water or milk enters. Water and watery substances tend to reduce the temperature, while fatty substances tend to raise it. (See &quot; Temperature of Fats and Other Substances.&quot;)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Pewter and Britannia both melt at a low temper- Pewterand ature, and should be used only for such purposes <span class="gstxt_sup">Bntanma</span>&#39; as do not require a dry heat. These metals make satisfactory tea-pots, dish-covers, etc.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Every room that is occupied should be thoroughly aired each day. One can keep warmer in a room filled with pure air that has a temperature of 65&#176; than in a room where the temperature is much higher and the air impure. The temperature of the house should not exceed 70&#176;.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The rooms and hallways of the main portion of the house should be thrown together as much as possible, thus keeping an equal temperature throughout the house, and ^toeTM insuring a free circulation of air. If there is a window in the upper hall, or in a room opening off the hall, which may be kept slightly open, it will help keep the air of the house pure. The hot air that comes from the Method of ^<span class="gstxt_sup">urnace</span> supplies the house, to a certain extent, obtaining a with fresh air. If the house is heated by steam circulation <span class="gstxt_sub">or</span> ljot <span class="gstxt_sub">wa</span>t<span class="gstxt_sub">er,</span> this supply is lacking, and there is greater need of some openings that will admit pure air. A piece of board about two or three inches wide, and as long as the window is broad, may be placed under the lower sash of one or two windows, as, for example, the hall windows. This will give access to fresh air without makinga draft, and is a good arrangement for bedroom windows in extremely cold weather.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are patent ventilators that fit under the sash in this manner, which are very satisfactory. They are in the form of a narrow box, one side of which has a number of small openings, the top being covered with fine wire netting. There are slides that may be drawn over this netting when one wishes to exclude all or part of the air. These boxes are placed under the sash, with the openings on the outside.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Many people cannot sleep with the windows open at night or in damp weather. A screen which will admit pure air, Screen for and yet keep out the dampness, should be provided excluding f<span class="gstxt_sub">or</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">suc</span>h cases, and may be made in this manner: dampness. p<span class="gstxt_sub">as</span>&#163;<span class="gstxt_sub">en</span> <i>^<span class="gstxt_sub">n</span> </i>Angora flannel to a frame similar to those used for mosquito nettings.

<p class='gtxt_body'>There are a few things that one should keep in mind in order that the ventilation of the house mayie done intelligently.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Some of the gases are at the ordinary temperature lighter than air, while others are heavier. Carbonic-acid gas (carbon dioxid) is about one and one half times as heavy as air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Remsen says: &quot;Pure air may be defined as air which consists of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxid in the proportions stated above&quot; (about f nitrogen, i oxygen, and <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Toto </span>carbon dioxid), &quot;together with some ofpurealr. water-vapor, ammonia, ozone, and hydrogen dioxid, and nothing of an injurious nature.&quot; It is evident from what has been said that there is constant danger of contamination from natural causes. The most common cause of contamination is the breathing of human Staminabeings in rooms which are inadequately supplied tdon. with air. The breathing process involves the using up of oxygen and the giving off of carbon dioxid and small quantities of organic matter which is undergoing decomposition. If the quantity of oxygen is reduced below a certain limit the air becomes unfit for breathing purposes, and evil effects follow. An ordinary inhalation will not then be sufficient to supply the blood with the oxygen necessary to purify it, and the system will begin to suffer. Headache, drowsiness, and a general sense of discomfort follow. The ill effects of breathing the air of a badly ventilated room occupied by a<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of the body are interfered with. The subject of ventilation has been so thoroughly discussed of late years that great improvement has been made in the arrangements for supplying pure air to dwelling-apartments and audiencehalls; but there is still room for improvement. Fortunately, in most buildings there is one source of supply of pure air which is independent of the architect&#39;s plans. This is the diffusion of gases through the porous materials of which the buildings are constructed. There is also a good deal of ventilation through the cracks and other apertures which are always to be found in our buildings.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;What it is in this bad air which causes these diseases has not yet been determined; but it seems probable, from researches on other diseases, that there are in the air microscopic germs which have the power to develop in the body and then to cause the symptoms which are referred to as malaria. Germs of one kind and another are undoubtedly present in great variety, and they play important parts in connection with the life and health of man, and also in the destruction of plants and animals in which life has become extinct.&quot;</p>

If we can but fix in our minds the effect some chemicals have on certain materials, it will help us to use them more intelligently.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Paint is softened by wet alkalis; when the solution is strong enough it dissolves the paint.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The alkalis most commonly used in the household are ammonia, sal-soda, potash, and borax. The most caustic of How to these alkalis are potash and sal-soda; the least test the caustic is borax. If we take a board which has <span class="gstxt_sup">e</span>alkalis&#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">f</span> been painted or varnished, and put a few drops each of a solution of soda, potash, ammonia, and borax on different parts, we can see how each affects the paint; the stronger the solution of any of them, of course the more quickly it will soften the paint. The same kind of a test might be made with a varnished surface.

The oil neutralized the power of the alkalis, and the injury done to the paint or varnish was the work of the few moments before the oil was added. If, however, the oil was applied in too small a quantity to wholly neutralize the alkali, the latter would continue its destructive work, but very slowly and feebly. If a large quantity of the oil is added <i>instantly </i>when the alkaline solution is dropped on the board, the effect upon the finish will be scarcely perceptible. We have learned from this simple experiment:</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Care of Natural-Wood Finish&#8212;To have the interior of the house finished in the natural wood is a great boon to the housekeeper, provided she takes proper care of it. One should avoid using water on these woods as much as possible. Oil and turpentine or alcohol is the best substance with which to treat them, as it preserves the finish and the wood. When any place on the wood becomes very much soiled, it may be cleaned by rubbing with a woolen cloth wet with turpentine or kerosene. The turpentine removes the gloss, and should be followed with oil. A little tripoli can be moistened with oil and the spot cleaned with this. Once a year go over the woodwork with a mixture of paraffin-oil and tur- <span class="gstxt_sub">To</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">regtore</span> pentine, using equal parts of the oil and tur- dry or pentine, unless the finish looks dry and cracked, <span class="gstxt_sub">g</span>^^^ in which case rub in the pure oil.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Window-sashes that are finished in oil or varnish require special care.

Soapy water also cleans the glass easily. When glass is washed in cold water it should drain until nearly dry. It must then be polished with a clean, soft towel. It is more difficult to wash in cold water, and it takes longer to polish the glass.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Glass that has been washed in warm water with either soda, ammonia, or soap should be wiped at once.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A soft brush is required for cleaning cut glass. A clean towel should be spread on a tray, and each piece, Care of as it is wiped, should be placed on this. <span class="gstxt_sup">ont</span> 8<span class="gstxt_sup">lass</span>.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This precaution is particularly necessary with dishes that are deeply cut at the bottom. When placed on polished wood the moisture produces a white mark. Fine sawdust is very good for cut glass; it absorbs the <span class="gstxt_sub">sa</span>^<span class="gstxt_sub">us</span>&#176;f<span class="gstxt_sub">or</span> moisture from those parts that cannot be reached cut glass, with the cloth. After wiping the glass, bury it in a bed of sawdust, and let it remain half an hour or more. When the glass is removed from the sawdust, brush it with a soft brush, and polish with a soft cloth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A word of caution must be said here. The sawdust should come from a non-resinous wood, such as box or basswood; it must be fine, and free from any hard substance. If sawdust from pine or any resinous wood is used, the resin will stick to the glass, and it will be found most difficult to remove. The sawdust should be spread out to dry after having been used; in this way it may be employed a number of times.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>One thing must always be remembered: to scratch glass is to weaken that part, so that a little extra heat or cold, or a slight jar, will cause a break at that point. A grain of sand at the bottom of the dish-pan, or on &#176;<span class="gstxt_sub">s</span><span class="gstxt_sup">f</span> the dish-cloth, may make this little scratch which on glass, will split your beautiful dish in twain.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The kitchen and pantries should be well lighted and aired.

I should never advise its use, however, as it is cold for the feet. Linoleum is a most satisfactory floor-covering. It may be cleaned with ease, it is soft, warm, and elastic, and wears well.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tables and shelves, like the floors, when in white wood and kept in good condition are a delight to the eye; but to maintain them in this state means much work. Painted or varnished shelves are clean, and may be kept so ^dota!** with little trouble. A covering of white enameled cloth on the shelves and kitchen tables looks particularly well, and the work of taking care of it is very light. These coverings should be laid on smoothly and held in place with small tacks. Heat destroys the enamel, therefore hot dishes must not be placed directly on these covers.</p>

Systematic thoroughness, then, in the care of the kitchen utensils is absolutely necessary for their preservation and for perfection in cooking. With the proper appliances this is not a difficult task.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Plenty of hot water, soap, and towels, and willing hands are all that are needed to keep these articles in good order. Soiled utensils should not be left standing for the particles of food to harden on them; nor should a TM^^<span class="gstxt_sup">0</span>&#39; knife or spoon be used to scrape off these adher- uteSSf ing particles; such treatment soon destroys the enamel or plate. If a substance clings stubbornly to a dish or stew-pan, use the dish-cloth of wire rings. This cleans quickly, without scratching or otherwise injuring the surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As soon as each dish or stew-pan is emptied of its contents it should be filled with water; when dish-washing time comes, it will be found that all clinging particles are thoroughly soaked and may be rinsed off before the dishes are put into the pan of hot, soapy water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There should be no stint in towels, soap, and hot water. Towels for silver, glass, and china should be of linen.

There should be long cotton and linen towels in reach for handling hot pots and pans. A good length for these towels is forty-two inches. Then, there should be soft towels for the hands, a mixture of cotton and linen being better than all linen for this purpose. Two linen dishcloths,&#8212;which, by the way, should not be used after they have become so worn that they will leave lint on the dishes, &#8212;a wire dish-cloth, and a bunch of wooden skewers are indispensable.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Here is a good rule for the daily care of utensils. We will take it for granted that pots, pans, bowls, ejc, were put to soak as soon as they were emptied of their ruieforthe contents. Rinse off all particles of food that care of cling to the utensils. If there are spots where uterails ^<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> substance has stuck or burned on, rub with the wire dish-cloth until all traces are removed; never scrape with a knife or spoon. When all the dishes are cleaned in this way, fill a dish-pan half full of hot water, well soaped; nearly fill a second pan with clear hot water. Begin by washing the earthenware in the hot suds, rinse in the hot water, drain, and then wipe with clean, dry towels. Follow this method with the tins and granite-ware, then with the ironware, changing the waters, of course, as they become soiled or cool. Wash the outside and bottom of the utensils as carefully as the inside.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Any utensil in which frying has been done must be wiped with soft newspaper to remove all the grease before it is put in the water for washing. Use plenty of soap and very hot water when washing greasy cooking utensils. If frying-pans or kettles become rough and dark they can be made smooth and bright by scouring with soap and wood-ashes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Tin and iron should be wiped while still hot.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All grooves in cooking utensils may be cleaned with a wooden skewer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In thinking over the care of the kitchen, pantries, utensils, etc., it seems almost more important to speak of the things one should not do, rather than the things one should do; for a great deal of damage can be done in a short time, and the task of repairing it is discouraging and sometimes almost hopeless. ironware New iron is one of the most difficult materials improves one has to deal with in kitchen utensils; as it <span class="gstxt_sup">m</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">nS9</span>&#39; grows older, and the surface becomes more smooth with use and proper treatment, it is comparatively easy to keep it in good condition.</p>

As soon as the utensil has been emptied, when food has been cooked in it, fill it with water, and let it rest on the back of the range until you are ready to wash it. All particles of food adhering to it will be softened by this means, and may be washed off before the utensil is put in the dish-pan. Have hot soapy water in readiness; put one utensil at a time <i>into </i>the pan, and wash the inside and outside with equal care. When all the saucepans, kettles, etc., have been washed in this manner, rinse them in hot water, drain them, and wipe first with the dish-clo&#39;th, and then with a <i>dry </i>crash towel, rubbing hard.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This is the only treatment that will insure a perfect condition of iron- or steelware. Scouring the inside of iron or steel articles with any kind of sand soap or mineral soap makes the surface smooth and bright. Frying-pans, griddles, omelet-pans, etc., may be kept in perfect condition by this means.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The tea-kettle is one of the problems of the kitchen. It is difficult to keep it free from rust. If it could always be emptied and wiped dry when not needed, this might be prevented; but hot water is constantly in demand, and the teakettle seems to be the place where it should be found.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In any case, the tea-kettle should be washed out every day; for even clean water will be found to leave a deposit. This washing out had better be done in the evening, when the work for the day is over; it will insure tea-kettto? thorough drying, and will do a great deal toward preserving the tea-kettle in good condition. There are teakettles that are lined with white enamel, which can easily be kept in good condition.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In summer the windows should be opened every night and kept closed during the daytime. The reason for opening the windows at night and closing them in the daytime ^j^,^. is this: The outdoor air in the daytime is much dowB warmer than in the cellar. This warm, moist- &#171;i&#171;&gt;nM*e laden air enters the cooler atmosphere of the cellar, and the moisture condenses and rests on all surfaces, rusting metallic ones, and making the cellar damp and warm. By opening the windows at night and closing them in the daytime the cellar is kept dry, cool, and pure.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In winter, mild days should be selected for airing this part of the house.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the house is closed for the summer, it is best, when it can be done with safety, to leave two windows open on opposite sides of the cellar, that there may be a strong current of air blowing through all the time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Two sets of screens are necessary for the cellar The screens windows: strong gratings, as a protection against cellar! thieves, and fine wire netting, as a protection against flies and small animals.

<p class='gtxt_body'>using a chemical in the laundry, as elsewhere in <span class="gstxt_sub">are</span> <i><span class="gstxt_sub">mei</span> </i>the house, is that it is expected to do all the work, instead of its being looked upon simply as an aid. The chemical most commonly used in the laundry is sal-soda. If the water is hard, this or some other substance is almost a necessity.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When using soda, ammonia, borax, Javelle water, etc., it must always be borne in mind that they must not be used in such quantities that they do away with the work of rubbing. The rubbing will be less hard, and <i>^m^etc., </i>may be done in less time; that is all. The chemical loosens the dirt, so that it yields quickly to sopping, squeezing, or rubbing. All chemicals should be <i>dissolved </i>and then mixed with the water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All clothing should be rinsed very thoroughly. Careful When a chemical is employed the necessity for j^JSwary. thorough rinsing is even more important than when only soap and water are used. A chemical should be thoroughly dissolved and mixed with the water before the clothes are put in the tubs.</p>

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Good laundresses are not all of the same opinion as to the desirability of soaking the clothes several hours before washing. It seems to me reasonable that the dirt should yield more readily when the fabric has been soaked in tepid suds, or even in cold water, for several hours; and certainly when an alkali is used in this manner it does its best work, because it has time to act upon the dirt, which is removed</p>

If the boiler is to be placed on the top of the range, put it in place before filling.

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In washing flannels the first care is to prevent them from shrinking and to keep them soft. They should be washed on a clear bright day, and dried as quickly as possible.</p>
</div>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA103'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Shake all lint and dust from the flannels. Prepare three tubs with water as warm as the hand can bear comfortably. Put enough dissolved soap in one tub to make a strong suds, and to every three gallons &quot;ashing.<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> of water add one tablespoonful of borax dissolved in a pint of hot water, or instead of the borax two tablespoonfuls of household ammonia may be used. Put the white flannels in this suds, and wash them by sopping up and down and squeezing; rub them as little as possible. Squeeze them from this suds, and wash them in a second tub of warm water, to which has been added a little dissolved soap. Turn the garments in this water. If you like a little bluing in the flannels, have a third water of the same temperature as the other two, make it slightly blue, and put the washed flannels in it. Then put the flannels through the wringer, shake them well, and hang in the open air to dry. Before they are quite dry take them in, fold and roll in a clean cloth, and iron as soon as possible. The iron should not be very hot, and there should be a great deal of pressure used.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Rubbing flannel thickens and hardens it. Inequality in the temperature of the water in which flannels are washed and rinsed shrinks them. Never use yellow soap for washing flannels, because it contains resin, flannel!<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> which is bad for woolens.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the water is hard, a <i>little </i>dissolved borax or ammonia may be put in the last water. This will keep the flannels soft. If the state of the weather interferes with the drying in the open air, hang the flannels in a warm room, but not too near the fire, heating-pipes, or register, as a high temperature will harden and shrink them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The temperature of the water in which flan- Temperanels are washed is hot as important as that ^ter* each successive tubful through which they are mnstbe passed should be kept at the same tempera- uniform.<span class='gtxt_body'>
ture from the beginning of the washing of the flannels to the end. The work should be done as quickly as possible, and only one or two pieces should be wet at a time. As soon as the flannels are wrung out of the rinsing-water, shake them out and hang them out to dry. The thicker side should be uppermost. Pin the flannels on the line in such a manner that they will not be pulled out of shape. <span class="gstxt_sub">D</span> . Loosely knitted or crocheted articles are likely</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In washing blue flannels the color may be revived by acetic acid or vinegar. Put about a tablespoonful of the acid or a gill of vinegar in the rinsing-water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>SUMMARY</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Shake flannels free from lint and dust.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Never rub or wring flannels with the hands, as this twists and hardens the texture.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Dry as quickly as possible, but press before fully dried. Do not use <i>hot </i>water with flannels. Use borax with colored flannels, as ammonia changes the colors.</p>

One of the charms of fresh linen is the pure, delicate odor that should be a part of it.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is important that the iron should be <i>hot </i>when it is first used on articles that have been rawstarched, because it is only by this means that the starch becomes cooked and gummy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is equally important that there should be enough moisture in the fabric to combine with the starch. If a spot gets dry, it will not be either smooth or stiff. For this reason it is a good plan to have the portions that are not being ironed covered with a wet cloth. If a spot gets too dry, wring a clean cloth out of cold water, and dampen the place with it. It takes but little time to prepare raw starch, and the work of starching the articles is slight; but it requires the greatest care to iron a large piece so that it may be smooth and of equal stiffness in every part. The cloth must be <i>wet, </i>the iron <i>hot </i>at first, and the ironing must be continued until every thread is dry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In using boiled starch, the articles should be starched while wet. If the article is to be made very stiff, the starch must be used as hot as possible, and be rubbed and clapped into the linen. Great care must be taken to get the starch distributed evenly <i>through the threads </i>of the fabric, and to remove it as much as possible <i>from the surface. </i>It is a good plan, therefore, after the starch has been rubbed and clapped in, to draw the cuffs, collars, and shirt-bosoms through the fingers, thus removing the superfluous starch. Each plait of the shirt-bosom must be drawn between the forefinger and thumb.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>When clothing is folded properly, the ironing is half accomplished. The pieces should be folded as quickly as Prepara- possible after they are taken from the line. Have tionof the laundry or kitchen clean; spread a clean <i><span class="gstxt_sup">A</span>fm </i><span class="gstxt_sup">f</span>&#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span> i<span class="gstxt_sup">ronin</span>g<span class="gstxt_sup">-c</span>loth on the table; place a bowl of clean, warm water within reach, and beside it a small brush, something like a scrubbing-brush, but about one fourth as large. Spread one article at a time on the table, dip the brush lightly in the warm water, and sprinkle the piece with it, getting a fine spray on all parts. Continue this until all the plain clothes are dampened. Be careful to keep articles of the same kind together. Line the clothesbasket with a piece of clean cotton kept for this purpose.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Clear one end of the table for the folding, and begin with the smaller pieces. Plain articles, like napkins, towels, handkerchiefs, pillow-cases, etc., may be folded together.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Beginning with the napkins, lay a piece perfectly flat on the table, draw the edges straight, and pass the hand over the napkin, smoothing out the wrinkles; place anTMoiding<span class="gstxt_sup">0f</span> other napkin on this, drawing it out in the same manner. Continue this until all the napkins are in the pile; then roll firmly, and wrap a towel around them. The handkerchiefs and pillow-cases should be done in the same manner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The towels are to be folded in the middle, with the edges drawn straight and the fold in the middle laid perfectly even.

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For good work it is absolutely necessary that the table and ironing-board are firm and unwarped, and that their covering is soft and smooth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The table and board should each have a first cover of thick woolen or cotton material; an old blanket is excellent for this purpose, and over it there should be a clean white cotton cover. These coverings may be tacked permanently on the board, but they must be removed from the table as soon as the ironing is finished.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Spread the woolen cover in place, and tack it, using the smallest-sized tacks, under the edges of the board or table, drawing it tightly so that there shall not be the suggestion of a wrinkle. Now put on the white cotton cover. Tack this in the same way, taking care to keep it perfectly smooth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There must be a good fire for the ironing; it must not burn too rapidly, and it must never be ^^entiaf.<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> allowed to reach a white heat.</p>

This matter of the wick is a most important one, and should be better understood by the dealers in lamps and lamp supplies. When a salesman fits a lamp with a wick that is too small, and an explosion follows, why should he not be held equally guilty with the drug clerk who carelessly puts up a poison instead of the correct prescription? Many of the lamp explosions which are occurring constantly might be traced to this matter of too small a wick. It is a subject that concerns every housekeeper, and an effort should be made to have the lamps safe in this respect at least.</p>

When all the lamps are in order, fill them with oil, taking care to have the oil come within an inch of the top of the reservoir, as space must be allowed for the expansion of the oil, and for the fact that the wicks draw it upward.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Be sure that the tops are screwed on firmly. See that there is no dirt in the space around the burner which admits the air. If this place becomes obstructed the lamp will be deprived of one of the essential elements of combustion, oxygen, and it will not burn brightly. Wipe the lamps carefully, and put all the parts together.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The fuel that is used for cooking and heating is an important item for the housekeeper. This is one of the household supplies that should be bought in bulk whenever possible. The best time to lay in the yearly supply is in the late summer or early autumn. Certainly the arrangements as to price and time of delivery should be made in the summer, when, as a rule, prices are lower than later in the season.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If one lives in a city, and the coal is carried to the bin through a hole in the sidewalk, the care of putting away the coal is somewhat less than when one must see that the side of the house, lawn, and flower- <span class="gstxt_sub">titm</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">of</span> beds are properly protected.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>KINDS OF FUEL</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The cost and kind of fuel used depend largely upon the section of the country in which one lives. In New England wood and anthracite coal are the principal fuels. kindsof ^<span class="gstxt_sup">as</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span>d pet<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span>ol<span class="gstxt_sup">eum</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">ar</span>e used to some extent for fuel. heating and cooking, and the soft or bituminous</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>coal is sometimes used for grates. We speak of the two kinds of coal&#8212;anthracite and bituminous. These two coals are quite different in appearance and in manner of combustion. Pure anthracite has a high luster and burns without flame. Bituminous coal is</p>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA135'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>not so hard or lustrous, and burns with a flame; it also throws off black smoke, and for this reason is not used when the anthracite can be had at a reasonable price. There are grades of coal between the anthracite and the bituminous; for example, there is a bituminous coal which has been in the transition state and would have become good anthracite had the conditions remained favorable. This coal looks dull and breaks up more readily than the pure anthracite. It should not cost as much as the genuine hard coal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With nearly all coal-seams there is a slaty deposit. It is often as black as coal, but it splits in thin sheets, and it is not difficult to recognize it among the <span class="gstxt_sup">S</span>pogf<span class="gstxt_sub">t</span>^&quot; coals. The housekeeper should always make it a coal, point to examine the first load of coal, to see that it has the right appearance, <i>i. e., </i>that it looks brilliant and is not mixed with this slaty substance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are two kinds of anthracite coal&#8212;the white ash and the red. The combustion of the red ash is more perfect than that of the white ash. For the range or stoves a mixture of the two is excellent. The red ash generally costs a dollar more a ton than the white. Anthracite coal comes in a variety of sizes&#8212;nut, egg, range, grate, furnace, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In selecting coal, the size of the grate or fire-box must be taken into consideration. A small fire-box will require a smaller size of coal than would a large one, and so <span class="gstxt_sub">Sizeof</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">coal</span> it is with the grate. If one uses small coal in a grate the bars of which are far apart, there will naturally be a great deal of waste. So, really, one must make the acquaintance of furnace and range before ordering the supply of coal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Wood, in the ordinary household, is used more ^<span class="gstxt_sup">ood</span>, as a kindling than as a regular fuel. When em- etc!&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span>, ployed as a kindling there should be a mixture of hard and soft wood, well seasoned, cut short, and split rather fine.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When wood is used as a fuel in a stove or fireplace, at least three fourths of the supply should be hard wood. For the fireplace the pieces should be large; for the cookingstove there should be a mixture of fine and coarse wood. It is always better to have the wood cut too short than the least bit too long.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is very important that wood should be well seasoned. Green wood throws out very little heat, a great part of the heat being absorbed by the moisture in the wood.</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>CARE OF THE FURNACE FIRE</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All furnaces are constructed on certain general principles. In every furnace, no matter what particular make it may be, there are the hot-air pipes, the chimney-pipe, the tiorToftar damper for chimney-pipe, the check, the drafts in nace. the lower doors, the dust-damper, the water-pan, the fire-pot, and the cold-air box. The housekeeper should acquaint herself with them all at the start.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The shape of the fire-pot is important. A fire-pot that is deep, but small at the top, will not heat a house as well as The flre- <span class="gstxt_sup">one</span> *<span class="gstxt_sup">na</span>t i<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> shallower but has a broader top surpot. face.</p>

This will start a current of air upward. Now light the kindling, and put on the wood. After a few minutes put on a layer of coal. When this gets to burning well, add enough coal to make a deep bed.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Have the registers opened, and open the air-box. As soon as the coal shows that it is getting well ignited, close the drafts and let the fire burn slowly. When the house is warm enough, open the check a little.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This fire will require no more attention until evening, when a little more coal or cinders may be put on, and the damper opened a few minutes to let the gas escape. Close the drafts, and check the fire for the night.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE MORNING WORK</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In looking after the furnace in the morning, the check must first be closed and a thin layer of coal put on. Now take up the ashes that are in the bottom of the furnace. By the time this is done the fire will have ^ffire!<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> burned up. Next open the dust-damper and shake the fire, and with the long poker draw all the clinkers from the bottom of the grate. Then put on a thick bed of fresh coal, and, if you have hods or iron-clad barrels, take up the ashes. Let the fire burn for about ten minutes after the final coal has been put on, and close the smoke-damper, leaving a portion of the slide in the lower door open until the fire has burned up well,&#8212;that is, it should begin to look red on the top,&#8212;then close the slide.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In extremely cold weather the fire must be shaken down at night, and a good bed of coal put on. It is better to do this in the early part of the evening, so that the house may be comfortable. Sometimes, in very cold weather, weather, it may be necessary to have the slide in the lower door opened a tiny bit. In this case it will be advisable to put on a couple of hodfuls of coal in the middle of the day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>One should keep old gloves, a cap, and some light, loose overgarment to wear when attending to the furnace.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When a house is heated by a furnace, the cold-air box is an important adjunct of the heating system.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It must be remembered that nearly all the warm air that is driven through the pipes must come from out of doors impor- through the cold-air box; part of the air is drawn, tance of also, from the cellar. If the air thus heated and <span class="gstxt_sup">00</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">air</span> circulated through the house is pure, it follows that the atmosphere must be in a healthful condition, always provided that there is a proper outlet for the foul and exhausted air. If, on the contrary, the air that passes through the cold-air box and the air of the cellar are contaminated, the whole atmosphere of the house will be impure.</p>

Over the outside opening a fine wire netting should be fastened, and over this a coarser one for the protection of the first. These nettings should be removed occasionally to admit the long brush used in cleaning out the box.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It seems to me that if one can be sure that the supply of air is pure and the water-box is kept full, the hot-air furnace, taken all in all, gives the purest and most healthful atmosphere to a house.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>HEATING-STOVES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The management of fires in stoves used exclusively for heating purposes is practically the same as that of the furnace fire. The fire in a stove should be raked down and the ashes removed in the morning. ^J^f&#39; Fresh coal should be put on, and the drafts and fire, damper kept open long enough for the coal to ignite and the gas to pass off. The stove should then be closed, the damper always left slightly open to allow all gas to pass up the chimney. This precaution of leaving an outlet for the gas is necessary with all stoves, ranges, and furnaces, but with the stove in the living-rooms the greatest possible care must be taken that there is no chance for the escape of gas into the room.</p>

The ashes, by absorbing heat and impeding circulation, interfere with a proper heating of the oven.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Every morning, after the ashes have been removed and the fire made, all the dust should be brushed from every part of the range; it should then be rubbed off with a damp range!<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> paper, and the <i>top </i>polished with a thin coating of black-lead. Finally the dry blacking-brush should be used to polish every part.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Black-lead should never be put on over dirt, and, indeed, should only be used when the surface has lost its black look. The polishing should be brisk and thorough; if not, the bottoms of the saucepans will become soiled. This never happens when the range is properly polished. Throughout the day, whenever the range becomes soiled, rub it off with a soft newspaper.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>When clinkers adhere to the lining of the fire-box, they may be easily removed. Put a thick bed of oyster- or clamshells on the red-hot fire. The heat converts the shells into quicklime, which loosens the clinkers. If the shells are not to be had, put a few pounds of quicklime on the fire. In the morning, when the cinders and ashes are removed, the clinkers may be detached from the lining by a few light blows of the poker. If any still adhere, do not use force, but try the shells or lime again the next day.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The reason why there are clinkers at all in the range is because the fire has been allowed to burn up to a white heat. Proper attention to the fire, and a care to remove all substances from the lining of the fire-box every morning, thus keeping it smooth, will prevent this annoyance.</p>

Well-laundered table-linen, tableware that has been properly washed and wiped and that is arranged in an orderly manner, are the strongest factors in making a table elegant and attractive.

Such decorations are in place on the humblest or the most sumptuous tables.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The table-linen should be of as fine a quality as one&#39;s purse will allow.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The first proceeding in the laying of the table is the placing of the thick cloth, either felt, double Canton flannel, or one of the many thick materials that are made</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>dSL.<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span>** fo<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">tn</span>i<span class="gstxt_sup">s</span> purpose. When this under-cloth is smoothly in place, spread the linen cloth over it, taking care to have the crease in the middle of the cloth come exactly in the middle of the table, and crossing the crease of the cross-fold precisely at the center. The lines of the table being true, next put the plates in position. If you cannot measure accurately with your eye, use toeplatei. <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> yardstick to determine the distance between the plates, which should be at least twenty inches. When the plates are correctly placed it will be easy to arrange the table symmetrically. The center ornament should next be put in place, and after that the silver and glass.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Place knives and spoons at the right of the plate, having the ends of the handles near the edge of the table, the sharp<span class='gtxt_body'>
edge of the knives toward the plate, and the inside of the bowls of the spoons turned up. The forks should be at the left side of the plate, with the inside turned up. Knives Place the glasses at the right of the plate, the forks, and water-glass just coming to the point of the knife. Bosses. If carving-cloths are used, arrange them before ^p]^ the plates are put on the table. Fresh napkins may be put on the plates, or at the left-hand side of the plates; the napkins in rings go at the side of the plates.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Individual salt-cellars are the most satisfactory,, provided there are small spoons to go with them. In any case, whether individual or large salt-cellars are used, there must be a small spoon for each salt-cellar. The individual salt-cellars are placed at the top of the plates, the large ones at the corners of the table, or at the sides, where they may be within reach of several people. It is a saving of time for the waitress if water carafes are used. There should be one carafe to every three or four people. A bowl of crushed ice, if ice is served, and a spoon should be placed near the carafe.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE BREAKFAST-TABLE</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The arrangement of the breakfast-table is after the general plan already given. If fruit and mush are served, there should be a fruit-knife and teaspoon at the side of each plate with the knife. Finger-bowls and fruit-doilies should always be provided when fruit is served. <span class="gstxt_sub">ra</span>ngement</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Cups and saucers, sugar, cream, and rests for the hot coffee and milk, should be placed in front of the mistress of the house. Knife, fork, and spoons may be placed at the head of the table for serving the substantial dishes, and<span class='gtxt_body'>
small butter-plates and butter-knife may be set near the butter-dish. If there should be griddle-cakes, waffles, or fried mush, an extra set of knives, forks, and hot plates must be ready for this course.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In preparing the table for dinner follow the general directions for arranging the table. The carving-set and knifeand-fork rests may be laid at the carver&#39;s place; the soupladle goes at the place of the mistress.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Oil and vinegar bottles should be placed on small doilies at one side of the table, or, when the service is ample, they may be brought to the table when needed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The dishes for the various courses must be arranged in the pantry or on the sideboard. The bread for this meal may be laid in the fold of the napkin, or passed when the soup is served, or, if the service is limited, the plate of bread may be placed on the table.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If vegetables or a sauce are to be served with the meat, they should follow as quickly as possible, the waitress passing the dishes on a tray, or holding them in her <span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>H<span class="gstxt_sub">ow</span> </span>the hands.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Everything is served at the left, except water and other liquids that must be poured into a glass. All soiled dishes should be removed from the left. Sometimes this is done from the right.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The plate of soup, fish, meat, etc., should be <i>placed </i>in front of the person served, not held for him to take. The waitress should hold all large dishes in her hands, and pass small ones on a tray.</p>

everything except the glasses, olives, confectionery, and fruit must be removed, and the table must be brushed free from crumbs.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In order to make the various changes quickly, it will be found a great convenience to have a large table in the pantry off the dining-room, where the dishes may be placed as they are removed from the table. If there is a second person here, who can sort the dishes and put them aside as rapidly as they are brought out, matters will be much simplified.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The first consideration is the selection of your guests.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Having settled upon your guests, your next step <span class="gstxt_sup">th</span>^ is to provide the best entertainment that your genial. <i>means </i>and <i>style of living </i>will permit. Nothing can be in worse taste than to attempt to entertain in the same manner in which your friends entertain, if they are richer or poorer than yourself.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Never attempt more than you can do well with the appliances and help at your command. A simple dinner of three courses, where everything is of the best quality, <span class="gstxt_sub">Tobeaguc</span>_ perfectly cooked and served, and where the hos- <span class="gstxt_sub">cegB</span> a,^. tess is at her ease, is more likely to be a sue- nermustbe cess than an elaborate dinner, badly prepared and served, with a hostess distrait and embarrassed. Of course, if money is no consideration, and one has a wellequipped household, entertaining may be an easy matter for the hostess, if she has the true spirit of hospitality, and understands how to select her guests and control her forces. For the woman with but one servant, or the one who does her own work and who must make every dollar count, it is<span class='gtxt_body'>
another matter. At the same time, this latter class should not deprive themselves and their friends of one of the most delightful pleasures of domestic life.

<p class='gtxt_body'>limrtedser- Fashion changes in the manner of dinner-giving, as in everything else. Formerly the company dinner was, with its numerous courses and long hours at table, a thing to be dreaded as much by the guest as by the hostess. To-day the dinner is much simpler, and generally much more successful as a gastronomic and social affair.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In this country the order of a simple company dinner is about as follows. The first course is oysters or clams on the half-shell, or <i>canapes </i>of sardines, caviar, or some</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>the soup. This is followed by the fish, with which</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>a sauce is served, and, of course, bread. Some hostesses serve potato in some form with this course.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The next course, <i>releve, </i>may be either a joint of butcher meat or poultry, roasted, boiled, or broiled, and one vegetable. If the fish was boiled or baked, and served with a sauce, the releve may be omitted, and the entree come next. Following the entree may come a water-ice, half frozen, or a cheese course or vegetable course. After this course, roast or broiled poultry or game, with a salad which is to be eaten with it, is served. The salad may be of lettuce, sorrel, chicory, cresses, etc., with French dressing, or it may be of crisp white celery with mayonnaise dressing. Some light, cold, sweet dish may form the dessert. The dinner should be finished with small cups of strong black coffee, which may be served in the dining-room or in the drawing-room. Cream and sugar should be passed with the coffee. This would be considered by many dinner-givers as too simple an<span class='gtxt_body'>
entertainment; but if it is well cooked and served it will be an elegant and satisfactory one.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE DUTIES OF THE WAITRESS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The personal appearance of the waitress requires special attention. She should not be too large or too old. She should be trim in her appearance, quiet in manner, and light of foot. Her dress should always be <span class="gstxt_sub">a</span>pTMearclean and well fitting, and her apron, collar, and anee and cuffs spotless.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fashion at present decrees that the waitress should wear a black dress, white collar and cuffs, a white apron, and a small white cap. In many well-regulated households, however, the waitress wears a light print dress, a fashion which must always commend itself, because it means freshness and cleanliness. The waitress should wear boots with soft soles, or slippers, that she may move about the dining-room noiselessly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>She should understand her duties so well, and Theattenbe so attentive to the wants of the family, that Waitress it should not be necessary to ask for anything during a meal, unless a special taste that could not ordinarily have been anticipated is to be gratified.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>During a ceremonious dinner or luncheon it is particularly important that all the service should be rendered without a word being exchanged between mistress and maid. This can be accomplished only by seeing that the maid has a clear understanding of all that is required, and that she is watch<span class='gtxt_body'>ful of each guest. If she is in the daily habit of discharging these duties carefully, she will be in proper training for the more formal occasions. It takes constant practice to arrive at perfection.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The other duties of the waitress may be enumerated as</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>follows:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Before breakfast she should air and dust the diningroom, and if there is an open fire there she should make</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If but two maids are kept, the waitress then goes up-stairs and puts the beds and sleeping-rooms to air. After this her own breakfast will be ready.</p>

The table should be set, the bread, butter, and water prepared, and the meal served on time. If there are to be salads, cheese, fruit, etc., for this meal, the waitress usually prepares them. She also has charge of the pickles, olives, sardines, potted meats, fruits, and similar dainties.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>plates. is of the greatest importance that the waitress should understand the necessity of serving hot food on well-warmed plates, and cold food on absolutely cold plates. A cold plate will quickly absorb the heat from soup, sauce, meat, or fish, while a warm plate, by imparting its own heat, will ruin a food that should be served cold. At the same time, care must be taken to avoid going to the extreme of having the plates so hot that they are difficult to handle or will mar the surface of the table.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The bread for dinner is cut thick. If the loaf is a square one, the slices are divided into two or four parts, according to the size of the loaf. Slices from the round annex?1 French loaf are not subdivided. Bread for the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>other meals should be cut in <i>thin </i>slices. Since the duties of the waitress vary with the habits and circumstances of the family, I have attempted to give only such duties, and the methods of performing them, as are</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The waitress is made responsible for the silver, glass, and china, and she is expected to keep them clean and intact. To do this she must have proper appliances. There must be a place for everything, and everything jjJf^JjJlJ? must be kept in its place. Ample closet-room siblefor should be provided, that there may be no need of crowding the china, etc., or of piling a great many china, delicate dishes one upon another. There should be tables in the pantry, so that when the dining-table is being cleared it will not be difficult to dispose of the dishes. The sink must be so broad and the water-faucets so high that there shall be no danger of striking the dishes against the projecting faucets. If the sink is narrow and the faucets low, there should be a large tray of galvanized iron, which should be placed on a table, to hold the dish-pan. This precaution will be found to lessen greatly the danger of breakage. Having plenty of hot water, soap, and towels, and all other appliances, the waitress must do her part to protect the tableware, etc., committed to her charge. She should always observe the following rules:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. The water into which the glass or china is ^&#39;er^a<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> put <i>first </i>must not be too hot.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. A few pieces only must be put in the pan at a time, and heavy pieces should never be placed on small or delicate ones.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Each piece should be wiped with care, and pressure on fragile articles of glass or china should be avoided.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Care should be taken that no sharp, hard substance, like a grain of sand, is on the table or dish-cloth, or in.the dish-pan.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Delicate glass and china must not be exposed to extremes of heat or cold; as, for instance, a hot substance should not be put in a cold dish, or a cold substance, like a frozen mixture, must not be put into a dish that has not been gradually chilled.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A scrupulous observance of these little points will save a world of trouble and expense.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>PROTECTING THE TABLE FROM HOT DISHES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Food that should be served hot requires warm plates and serving-dishes, that it may lose none of its heat while being served and eaten. The serving-dish should be a little warmer than the plates.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As heat mars varnished and other polished surfaces, the table must be protected by some substance that will prevent</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>it from being reached by heat. The thick covers <span class="gstxt_sup">F</span>imder<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">are</span> P^<span class="gstxt_sup">ace</span>d <span class="gstxt_sup">un(</span>ler the table-cloth are usually</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>covers. made of cotton, a material which is not a good</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>non-conductor of heat. If, instead of this kind of cover, one of thick flannel is used, the chances of excessive heat passing through to the table would be greatly diminished. I should advise a thick flannel cover for a handsomely polished table-top.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Thick mats placed under platters and other hot dishes are a protection. Tiles are often used for this purpose, but</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>they absorb the heat from the dish and transmit</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>it to the table. If, however, the tiles are set on</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>little feet, or are in a frame which raises them from the table, they are a sufficient protection. Tiles are not satisfactory supports for a platter on which the joint, or any other piece that is to be carved, rests, as the dish is apt to slip about on the glazed surface. A thin pad of flannel may be covered with a linen slip and placed under the carving-cloth.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For coffee-pots, tea-pots, hot water, etc., there should be a broad tile or a slightly raised wire frame. On this place</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>a thin flannel pad covered with a linen slip. The fortea?and ^<span class="gstxt_sup">anne</span>l *<span class="gstxt_sup">s</span> necessary between the tile or wire frame, coffee-pots, as it conserves the heat in the vessel set upon it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If, for example, the tea- or coffee-pot is placed directly on the cold tile, it parts with its heat rapidly, so that<span class='gtxt_body'>
in protecting the polish of one&#39;s table one must not lose sight of the fact that a beautifully polished surface is a costly luxury indeed if, for the sake of preserving it, one&#39;s food and drink may never be kept at a proper temperature. But with the pads of non-conducting material, and with tiles or some other supports that are raised sufficiently to allow a current of air to pass between them and the table, food may be kept hot and the polish of the table preserved at the same time.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Study the anatomy of the animal so as to know how to locate all the bones. (See Fig. 10.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Study the muscular system, that the position of the muscles and tendons may be clear in the</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>mind. This will help to an understanding of how <span class="gstxt_sub">0</span>f study, the meat should be cut so that the slices shall be across the grain. (See Fig. 14.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Study the change of position of bones and muscles in the hind quarter, as shown in Figs. 15 and 16.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. Become familiar with the interior of a side of beef (Fig. 17), noting the position of the spine, ribs, sternum, kidney, suet, and tenderloin.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Study the outline of the outside of the side of beef (Fig. 18), the position of each cut, and its relation to the bones of the skeleton. Look at Fig. 14, and from that locate in each cut the direction in which the muscles run.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>One should become familiar with the texture <span class="gstxt_sub">Color</span> <i><span class="gstxt_sub">gim</span> </i>and color while studying the bones and muscles of and&#39;text-&#39; the animal. There are certain things that can be &quot;^gTM^<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> learned only by personal observation.

Hence certain joints that, when taken from beef or mutton, require cooking slowly for a long time to make them tender, may, when taken from lamb or veal, be cooked by the quicker methods, such as roasting or broiling. Take, for example, the neck or breast of any animal. To save confusion by a multiplicity of diagrams, a side of mutton has been taken to illustrate the methods of cutting the smaller animals. (See Fig. 24.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The quality of meat depends upon many things&#8212;the age, breed, etc., of the animal, the amount of exercise, the kind of food, the mode of dressing, and the time given to ripening.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Beef.&#8212;The ox, steer, heifer, and cow yield the meat known as beef. These animals are dressed at the source of supply, or are sent alive to the local markets, in well-venknown as tilated and watered cars, where they are dressed. Chicago- In the last fifteen or twenty years there have been <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>fceet g<span class="gstxt_sup">rea</span>t changes in the manner of supplying the markets with beef. Previous to that time it was nearly all dressed in the locality in which it was sold. This meant for the cattle long, exhaustive journeys in crowded cars. Now the greater part of the beef is dressed near the source which supplies the cattle, and it goes by the name of Chicago-dressed beef.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA171'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At the outset this method of supplying the market met with opposition. Naturally, while in an experimental stage many mistakes were made. The beef was often packed in the refrigerators before all the animal heat had passed off, and, as a consequence, when it reached the Eastern market it had acquired a peculiar and disagreeable taste. Sometimes other preservatives than cold were employed. All this has been changed, and now one cannot ask for anything better than a joint from a prime Chicago-dressed animal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>At these large establishments they have the best appliances for doing the work in the quickest, most painless and sanitary manner. They also have methods for utilizing the tougher and less sought after portions of the animal, sending East the most marketable portions. This gives a different-looking side from that of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home-dressed </span>beef, there being less flank and often no neck; but in the final cutting into joints there is practically no difference from the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home</span>dressed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The quality of beef, as of all kinds of meat, depends upon the age of the animal and how fed. Butchers consider that the age between four and eight years gives the - ^ <span class="gstxt_sub">of</span> best beef. In former years none but &quot;stall-fed beef debeef &quot;&#8212;1 e., an animal that was kept for months pendsupon in the barn and fed largely on grain&#8212;was consid- &quot;f<span class="gstxt_sub">n</span>jmai ered prime. This is practically true now. The and how it flesh is made rapidly, and is shorter grained and <span class="gstxt_sup">ha</span>f<span class="gstxt_sub">e</span>a<span class="gstxt_sup">Mn</span> more tender than the grass-fed animal; yet there can be no doubt but that a combination of the two methods will give a healthier meat, for while the exercise in the open air tends to toughen the muscles, it also makes them more healthy and of a finer flavor. It is true of all animals that little exercise and generous feeding with grain produce tender flesh, which grows plump in cooking.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Beef should hang until well ripened&#8212;not less than three weeks, longer when possible.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Good beef will be firm, fine-grained, the color when first cut a purplish red, but on exposure to the air for a few minutes becoming a bright red.

The fat should be a light straw-color; the kidney suet should be white, firm, dry, and crumbly.

<p class='gtxt_body'>The fat of poor beef is a dark yellow, the suet oily, tough, and fibrous. The lean is coarse, open-grained and flabby, Some in <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span>d o^<span class="gstxt_sup">en</span> Q<span class="gstxt_sup">u</span>it<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> dark.</p>

These are divided into hind quarters and fore quarters&#8212;the loin, rump, round, leg, and flank going on the hind quarter, and ribs, shoulder, brisket, cross-ribs, etc., going on the fore quarter; these quarters are again subdivided.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The division into quarters is practically the same all over the country, but the subdivision varies in different sections. The New York method is followed nearly all over the country, except in some parts of New England and Pennsylvania. When once the anatomy of the animal and the muscular system is understood, a knowledge of the various cuts and their uses may be acquired readily.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The skeleton is covered with a thick layer of muscular fibers; this is known as lean beef. These muscles are the<span class='gtxt_body'>
active organs of movement. There is not a movement of the body, no matter how slight, that does not require the aid of one or more sets of muscles. The more active they are, the more freely the blood flows <i>J^Zj^L </i>through them, and, as a consequence, they are muscle, healthier than when not exercised. But with exercise they become firmer and harder. This is seen, for example, in the beef. The legs, sides, shoulders, and neck are exercised more than the back and the tenderloin, and are therefore tougher, but also more highly flavored and more nutritious, than the tender and less-exercised parts.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Below are cuts of muscular fiber. Fig. 11 shows the arrangement in bundles; Fig. 12, the fiber partially separated into fibrils; Fig. 13, the fiber cut across the grain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>From these three examples one can see how important it is that the muscles should be cut across the grain instead of the length of the fiber, if one would have tender meat.</p>

Examine the bones of the spine in each section, that you may be able to recognize them in the cuts of meat that come from these parts, always remembering, of course, that each bone is ^J^&quot; split into two parts, and that you find but one Kg. io. half of it in the joint of meat. (The split side is shown in Fig. 17.) <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> </i>to <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">2</span> </i>is that part of the spine belonging to the neck. Beginning at a<span class="gstxt_sup">2</span> and going back to <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span> </i>are found the joints to which are attached the six chuck ribs. The projections on these joints are partially hidden by the shoulder-blade, but they are quite long. Beginning at the point <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span> </i>and going back Fig. 13. to a<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> are the joints to which the seven prime</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ribs are attached. From a<span class="gstxt_sup">4</span> to a<span class="gstxt_sup">5</span> are the joints of the loin. The tenderloin begins in a small point under the first rib, and it increases in thickness as it runs back. It finally terminates in an obtuse point at the hipbone. The tenderloin is covered with a thick bed of suet. The kidneys are embedded in this at the end near the ribs.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>(See Fig. 17.) It is from this section that the sirloin and porterhouse roasts or steaks are cut.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The point between <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">5</span> </i>and <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> </i>in the New York method of cutting is left on the sirloin, while in Boston and Philadelphia it is left on the rump.

Seeing this change in the skeleton and muscles, it will be easy to understand how and why the hind quarter is cut in a certain manner when we come to the diagram illustrating methods of cutting beef. (Fig. 18.) If the carver will study Figs. 15 and 16, he will learn the position of the bones and direction of the muscles in the leg or hind quarter of mutton, lamb, veal, venison, etc., and will then know how to carve so as to cut across the grain of the muscular fibers.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The point at <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> </i>is where the aitchbone is divided into two parts. The thigh-bone below the straight line belongs to the round.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Observe the formation of the shoulder-blade at c and <i>d. </i>The upper part (c) is thick cartilage, which touches the seventh rib; therefore it does not lessen the value of this joint; but beginning with the eighth rib there is both bone and cartilage. Here is where the chuck ribs begin.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A cut that used to be very popular for a cheap roast, steaks, pot-roast, stewing, etc., was the &quot;cross-rib piece,&quot; known also as &quot;shoulder clod,&quot; &quot;bowler piece.&quot; It is still cut by many butchers.

There are more bones to move in this part; hence the greater number of sets of muscles, and the necessity for their going in many directions. Each cluster of muscles is finished at the ends with a smooth, white, tough substance, the tendons, by which they are attached to the bones. The tendons become gelatinous on being subjected to long, slow cooking. They are what make the drumsticks of roast poultry and the knuckle of mutton or lamb, when properly cooked, such delicious, succulent morsels, and when cooked at too high a temperature, such hard, unsavory food.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As cut in New York, and wherever the New York method is followed, these roasts and steaks contain both tender and tough portions. This is particularly true in the case of the steaks, some butchers cutting the whole length, from the backbone to the end of the thigh-bone.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Second quality. </i>The pieces included in this grade are often used for roasting and broiling, also for braizing, stewing, pot-roasts, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The best part of the top of the round <i>(g, g, </i>Fig. 17) is often used for steaks, roasts, pot-pie, boiled, braized, or alamode beef. From a prime animal this is a most satisfactory piece. There is little, if any, bone (some butchers remove the thighbone, while others leave it in the round), and only a desirable quantity of fat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The eighth and ninth ribs, first cut of the chuck, make a fair roast; the shoulder-blade should be removed and the piece be firmly skewered. The tenth and eleventh ribs are often boned, and sold as rib or chuck steaks, or are rolled, and sold as rolled ribs for roasting, braizing, or pot-roasts. Even the twelfth and thirteenth ribs are treated in this manner in some markets. Sometimes these last two ribs and part of the neck are used for Hamburg steaks.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The tougher ribs (ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen) may be used for braizing or pot-roasts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <i>cross-rib piece </i>makes a good economical roast or steaks. By consulting Figs. 14 and 18 it will be seen that the muscles of this piece all run in one general direction. It is an economical cut, being solid meat.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Third quality. </i>The cuts belonging to this class are all much tougher than the foregoing, and require long, slow cooking. The rump piece (Fig. 14, <i>a<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> </i>to a<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span>) is generally corned where the New York method of cutting is employed. It is cut in two parts, horizontal with the backbone, thus taking in the thick part of the hipbone in one piece, and the backbone in the other piece; the latter piece is the better of the two. By the Boston and Philadelphia methods of cutting, a portion of this cut goes on the part known as the back of the rump, and is used for roasts and steaks.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The <i>flank </i>and <i>leg </i>are used for stewing, braizing, soups, etc. The flank has no bone; the muscles are coarse, loose, and tough; but this piece of meat is very juicy and has a fine flavor.

<p class='gtxt_body'>and finer flavored will be the beef. Always aim to purchase a piece of corned beef that has a good layer of fat. Corned beef Housekeepers often have a decided choice as to must not the cut of corned beef that they will use. The cook rap- thick end of the brisket, the rump piece, and the plate will all, if from a good animal, be satisfactory, provided they are cooked five hours, with the water just bubbling at one side of the kettle. Take the finest quality of corned beef in the world, and let it boil rapidly, and you will have a piece of meat that will break under the carvingknife into a bundle of hard, dry, uneatable threads.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Veal.&#8212;The best veal is that fed wholly on milk; next comes that fed on milk and meal; the poorest is that which has been grass-fed. The best age for veal is when the calf feeding* <i>*<span class="gstxt_sup">s</span> </i>between six and ten weeks old. The flesh of a well-fed milk calf will be fine-grained, tender, and white, with just a suggestion of pink. The fat will be firm and white, and there will be a generous supply of it round the kidneys and on the legs. Calves that are fed on part milk and part meal are nearly as good as the milk-fed, provided the feeding is done carefully. The grass-fed calf gives a very poor veal, lean, dry, and dark; still it is not unsanitary. The veal that comes from a calf that has been killed too soon&#8212;between two and four weeks&#8212;will be soft, flabby, and of a bluish tinge. There should be no sale for such meat, for it is both innutritious and unhealthful.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Veal is not highly estimated in this country, and since creameries, condensing factories, and cheese factories are planted in every good grazing section of the country, the farmers find it more profitable to sell their milk, and destroy the calves when they are only a few days old. In France, where veal is valued highly, the greatest care is taken to have it in perfection. The prime veal is raised in the following manner. The calf is given all the milk it can take, first from the mother, and as it grows older it has the milk of a<span class='gtxt_body'>
second cow also. When the veal is to be particularly fine, eggs are fed to the calf the last two or three weeks of its fattening. They begin with one or two eggs, then increase the number from day to day until they use six or eight a day. The calf&#39;s mouth is opened, and the whole egg, shell and all, is dropped in; the closing of the mouth crushes the egg, and it is swallowed. When calves are fed partially on milk and partially on meal, and the eggs are added, the veal is almost as fine as that of the milk-fed calves. Nowhere else in the world does one find such veal as is found in France, and no one complains of its disagreeing with them. All the French veal, however, is not thus carefully fattened; but where the best is so fine it is difficult to sell a very inferior article.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The calf is divided into leg, loin, breast, shoulder, neck, flank, head, and feet. The leg is the most valuable part of the animal. It is cut into slices for <span class="gstxt_sup">H</span><span class="gstxt_sub">c</span>&#176;^<span class="gstxt_sub">f</span>*j<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> cutlets, into one solid round piece for fillet; the divided, thick, tender part is cut into one large, wellshaped piece for fricandeau; a portion of the leg is sometimes boned and roasted. There is no waste in these cuts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The lower part of the leg is very gelatinous, and is used for soups; it is called a knuckle of veal.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Next in value to the leg is the loin; this cut includes what is known in beef as the porterhouse, sirloin, and rump, and is divided into roasts and chops. The neck comprises the thirteen ribs, which are roasted or used as cutlets.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The shoulder is roasted or braized. The breast is roasted, stewed, broiled, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Mutton.&#8212;Good mutton, properly cooked, is one of the most nutritious and easily digested animal foods. Because of the indifferent quality and improper cooking of a great deal of this valuable food, many people in this country have a strong prejudice against it.

more savory and appetizing than a roast, boiled, or broiled piece of mutton.</span></p>

Sheep that have been pastured on hilly land, where sweet herbs are found, have a peculiarly fine flavor. The bones should be small; the lean fine-grained, a rich red, and juicy; the fat firm and white. A lean animal does not produce good meat. There should be a mustbe <i>thick </i>layer of fat on the back and the thick part thoroughly of the legs. The neck and shoulders are always</p>

In winter this can be from three to six weeks; in summer, except in cold storage, it is not possible to keep it so long.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The various cuts of mutton are the leg, loin, shoulder, neck, breast, flank. When the leg and loin make one joint it is called a haunch of mutton. When the two loins are left together the joint is called a saddle.</p>

When Tutsof&#39; <span class="gstxt_sup">rum</span>P <span class="gstxt_sup">and</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> small piece of the tail are left mutton, on the loins it is called a long saddle. (See Fig. 29.) When only the loins constitute the piece, it is a short saddle.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sometimes the ribs and loin are left in one piece; it is then called the rack. As a rule the first eight ribs and the loin are cut into chops. When the thin bones of the rib chops are trimmed they are then called French chops. These chops are a delicate, appetizing dish, but expensive, as the proportion of lean meat to fat and bone is so small. The loin chops are what in the beef would be called porterhouse or sirloin steaks. They are more profitable to buy than the rib chops. The chuck ribs are sometimes cut into chops and<span class='gtxt_body'>
the shoulder-blade removed. These chops have a good deal of meat on them, but it is too tough for broiling, except in the case of a very tender animal.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MUSCULAR <br/>          FLESH OF ANIMALS <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The flesh of the mature animal is improved by hanging for a long time in a low, dry temperature. It is more nutritious, more highly flavored, and more digestible than that of the immature animal, the flesh of which is watery and gelatinous, and spoils quickly. Consequently in making broths for the sick this fact should be kept in mind, and the well-exercised muscles of the mature animal should be used for this purpose. Nearly all the immature animals are in market through the spring and summer, and to some extent in the fall; but there is little of this kind of meat to be found on sale in the winter.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Rigor Mortis.&#8212;After the death of an animal the muscles become rigid. Sometimes this occurs very quickly, and, again, it may be hours before this state is developed. This<span class='gtxt_body'>
stiffening of the muscles is supposed to be due to the separation and coagulation of the albuminoid substance in the fluid of the muscles. After a time (sometimes many days, and, again, in a few hours) the muscles relax, some change taking place in the albuminoid.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Effect of Freezing.&#8212;In meat, as in all substances, the tendency of freezing is to separate the liquid from the more solid parts. Meat (cooked or uncooked) that has been frozen is never so juicy as it would be if it had not been frozen; after being in that state and then thawed, it should be cooked as soon as possible, as it will not keep well.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>THE MINOR PARTS OF THE ANIMAL</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are portions of the animal which are variously esteemed. In the city markets one finds almost every part and organ of the animal on sale. In some country places the butchers do not take the trouble to dress the head, feet, or any of the internal organs, except the liver; but in the hog the head and feet are generally dressed and sold.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The feet of sheep, calves, and hogs are cleaned, boiled, and pickled, or they are used in stews, or fried in crumbs after</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Feet having been boiled. Calves, feet are also used in soups and jellies; these and pigs, feet are most highly prized. The feet of all animals are very gelatinous.<span class='gtxt_body'>
On the continent of Europe they use the feet of poultry in soups and ragouts. They are sold in the market like the feet of butchers&#39; meat; they are a desirable addition to a stock, giving it extra body.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Calves&#39; and pigs&#39; heads are more desirable than any others; they are found in the markets, thoroughly Heads cleaned. Sometimes half a head can be purchased.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The liver of all the animals is sold as food. Calves&#39; liver is the best; it is usually light and clear in color <span class="gstxt_sub">u</span> and tender in texture. Beeves&#39; liver is dark and often hard or tough. Pigs&#39; liver is, by many people, preferred to beeves&#39; liver.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The liver is the largest gland in the animal. Physiologists are still in doubt as to what all its functions are, but it is agreed that one of its offices is to maintain the <span class="gstxt_sub">The</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">liver</span> uniform composition of the blood. It is one of should the organs that is frequently diseased; therefore ^JS^ it should never be used without being first thor- examined oughly examined. If the texture is clear and before smooth one can be reasonably certain that it is in a <span class="gstxt_sup">usms</span>healthy condition. If, on the contrary, there are streaks or spots in it, it must be discarded. These indications hold true also in the case of the livers of poultry or birds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Kidneys.&#8212;Veal, lamb, mutton, and beef kidneys are all used as food; they, like the liver, should be examined carefully. Good healthy kidneys will have a clear, bright color; if diseased they will be cloudy and contain spots. &#8226;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Hearts.&#8212;The hearts of animals, when cooked with care, make a cheap, nutritious dish. They may be stewed, baked, or braized.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tongues.&#8212;The tongues of all animals are used for food. They should be firm and plump; when lean and flabby they will not make a tender dish.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tripe.&#8212;The stomach of the ox furnishes tripe. The butcher sells it cleaned and boiled. It should be plump,<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Sweetbreads.&#8212;The thymus and pancreatic glands of the young calf and lamb are sold in the city markets as sweetQuaii de- breads. Fo<span class="gstxt_sup">rmer</span>ly <span class="gstxt_sup">on</span>ly the heart sweetbread (panpends<span class="gstxt_sup">7</span>on creas) was sold, the thymus being left in the food and neck. The demand for these glands is now so animal, great that the two are left together and sold as a pair&quot;. They vary greatly both as to size and quality, depending upon the age, food, and condition of the animal. For this reason it would seem more just to sell them by the pound (as is done sometimes) rather than by the pair. When the sweetbreads are taken from an animal that has been fed wholly and generously on sweet milk they are plump, white, compact, and firm. If the animal was not properly fed, or was pastured, they will be dark, flabby, and tough.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>These glands are rarely taken from any but the young calf or lamb, and, as a rule, the thymus gland has either been absorbed or changed to a fatty or fibrous substance at the end of the first year of the life of the animal. The pancreas becomes tougher and darker, but it is never changed or eliminated, as is the thymus gland. It is not, however, an unusual thing to find these glands in a steer three or four years old in such fine condition that they make a very good dish.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sweetbreads spoil quickly; therefore they should not be kept many days, unless it be in cold storage. The fine ones are often frozen for use in winter, when veal is scarce.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The brains, palates, eyes, marrow-bones, lungs, etc., are all employed as food. The brains of the calf, sheep, and lamb are the best. The marrow-bones from beef are those usually employed.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>GAME AND POULTRY</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Under the head of game is comprehended venison (the meat of the deer), bear-meat, rabbits, squirrels, many varieties of duck, partridge, grouse, ptarmigan, quail, woodcock, wild pigeons, and a great many small birds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The venison is cut very much like mutton. It should hang long enough to get thoroughly ripened&#8212;three weeks or more. Venison to be good must be fat; the lean venison is much darker than that of beef, and the fat whiter. This is one of the meats that must be served rare and hot, if you would have it in perfection.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Game birds do not have the feathers removed until they are to be used. Let the butcher have this done before sending them to you. Be sure that the skin is not <span class="gstxt_sub">Gamebirds</span> torn off, as it is very necessary in cooking birds.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Rabbits and squirrels should not be skinned until they are to be used; like birds, they dry if their natural covering is removed any length of time before cooking. Rab- Rabbits bit-meat is white, delicate, and savory when young, and but dark and tough when old. The claws are rough <span class="gstxt_sup">8&lt;</span>l<span class="gstxt_sup">uirrels&gt;</span> and long in old rabbits; when tough they should be cooked slowly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Gamebirds are generally sold so much a piece, pair, or dozen.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Poultry.&#8212;The question as to whether poultry for the market should be drawn or undrawn has been settled differently by different States. It is a great pity that any State should decide in favor of undrawn poultry. Where this is the law, there certainly should also be a law, which should be enforced, that the animal go without food long enough to empty the crop. This is the law in some States, but it is not always observed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are two methods of removing the feathers from poultry, one by plucking them from the dry bird, and the<span class='gtxt_body'>
other by first plunging it into boiling water. By the latter method the feathers are removed more easily than by the &#39;former, but the water injures the flavor of the <span class="gstxt_sup">Dp</span>y^<span class="gstxt_sup">ked</span> meat and impairs its keeping qualities. scalded. To know which is scalded and which is drypicked is a simple matter. The hot water contracts the skin, which is drawn tightly over the flesh, giving the bird a plump, attractive appearance. In the dry-picked bird the skin is loose and may be moved about on the flesh, and it has a rather rough appearance. To the novice it will look less attractive than the scalded bird. Dry-picked poultry is generally several cents more per pound than the scalded, but it is worth the difference.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Some of the tests of good poultry are: (1) the bird should be short and plump in proportion to its weight;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>(2) skin smooth, but not the smoothness that comes <span class="gstxt_sup">T</span>good&#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">f</span> fr<span class="gstxt_sup">om</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">sca</span>^ing; (3) legs smooth; (4) toes pliable; poultry.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Poultry, like all other meat, must be fat to be good. Housekeepers have their preference as to yellow or white fowl; mine is for the yellow, as it seems to me that the flavor is richer than in the white chicken.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Marketmen have a way of putting one of each in a pair, but they will change to whichever kind you prefer.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Fish.&#8212;The first consideration in choosing fish is that it be fresh. For this reason it is better to use such fish as is caught near <span class="gstxt_hlt">home </span>than that which must be brought from a distance. The firmer the flesh of the fish, the longer j&#163; Quality. time it will keep in good condition. All fish contain a thin albuminous substance, which in cooking is changed to a white curd if the fish is fresh and in a healthy condition. This is very noticeable in cod and halibut, and all fish of this class, where it makes a thin layer of a soft, creamy substance between the flakes. If the fish has been kept too long this substance undergoes a change which prevents its coagulation, and the cooked fish is watery and of a bluish appearance, instead of being firm and white. Sometimes in the spawning season the cooked fish, even when perfectly fresh, has the same blue appearance.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fresh fish will be firm, the scales bright, the gills red, the fins firm and erect. The fish from pure running streams, clear ponds and lakes, and from the ocean are the safest and best. Fish are very sanitary, and do not live in any great number in waters that are badly polluted, but they may absorb just enough of the pollution to make them unhealthy and often dangerous, as, for example, oysters that grow in beds at the mouths of rivers from which sewage is discharged into the ocean or bay. Fish that inhabit stagnant waters or live at the bottom of muddy ponds never have a fine flavor, and one cannot feel that they may be as healthy as those from pure waters.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The care and purchase of household supplies depend upon where and how one lives. The family in a flat with little or no storage accommodation must of necessity buy only in small quantities, while the householder with cellar and plenty of other storage-room will find it a saving of time and money<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Green vegetables should be purchased only when needed. If asparagus or lettuce must be kept for a day or two, put some water in a shallow dish, and let the roots rest in the water, which should never be more than an inch deep.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Winter vegetables should be perfectly ripe before being gathered. The skin on fruit or vegetable, when fully ripe, forms an almost impervious covering, through which but little moisture can escape. If, however, it is picked before it is ripe, the moisture passes through the porous skin, and the fruit or vegetable shrinks.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All winter vegetables should be dried before being stored, and they should be placed in a cool, dry place.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Eggs are cheapest in the late spring, summer, and fall. Many housekeepers buy a quantity of eggs when they are cheap, and preserve them for the time when eggs are scarce and expensive. If the shells of the fresh eggs are coated<span class='gtxt_body'>
with some substance that will exclude the air, the eggs will keep very well for many months. It must be remembered, however, that eggs absorb flavor through their porous shell, and they should not be coated with or packed in any substance that can communicate a disagreeable flavor to them. Sometimes quite fresh eggs are spoiled by being packed for a few days in musty oats.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To test the freshness of eggs, make a salt solution of one quart of water and two tablespoonfuls of salt. A fresh egg will sink in this; an egg that is not very stale will give just a suggestion of rising, and a very stale egg will float readily.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Butter.&#8212;The mode of making and preserving butter has materially changed in late years. Dairy butter is no longer made in large quantities and stored, as in former years. Creamery butter has practically taken the place of the oldfashioned dairy butter; the former does not keep well, and only small quantities should be purchased at a time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the cows are pastured in spring, summer, and fall, the butter is richer and of finer flavor than that made from the winter cream, and less of it may be used in making cake and pastry.</p>

Fresh and stale milk should never be mixed, unless they are to be cooked at once.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Groceries.&#8212;Even in small apartments it is wise to purchase at least a month&#39;s supply of groceries, as it is a great waste of time and patience to find each day that something is wanting that necessitates a trip to the grocer&#39;s, and perhaps delay in preparing a dish which requires but one thing to complete it. Every store-closet should be supplied with sugar, flour, tea, coifee, chocolate, eggs, breakfast cereals (if used), molasses, salt, pepper, spice, rice, macaroni, bicarbonate of soda, cream of tartar, baking-powder, flavoring extracts, vinegar, gelatin, barley, starch, bluing, soap, and sal-soda.</p>

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body' style='margin-bottom: 1.5em;'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There was an old saying among the French that it was as disgraceful for a host not to know how to carve well as it was to have a fine library and not know how to read. Nowadays one is constantly hearing the complaint that carving is a lost art since the Russian style of serving has been in vogue. It is certainly true that for large and ceremonious dinners the carving is not done at the table; but there are few heads of families who, having been accustomed to good living, would willingly, under ordinary circumstances, relinquish the duty and pleasure of carving the joints, poultry, or game served on their own tables. Roasted and boiled meats may only be served in perfection by being carved quickly and well on the table. It is impossible to serve a portion of meat hot, crisp, and juicy from an adjoining room. Besides, there are comparatively few households that can afford a skilled butler or cook who can carve daintily and to good advantage.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of every young man and woman. It is not a difficult art to master, provided one goes about&#39; it in the right ctandittong manner. If one understands the anatomy of necessary the joint or bird, and the direction in which for good the muscular fibers run, half the battle is won. <span class="gstxt_sup">camn</span>6</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Some of the conditions necessary for success are a cool head, control of one,s temper, a sharp knife, a seat high enough to bring the elbows on a line with the table, ample space, a dish that stands firmly on the table and large enough to allow the joint to be carved without any danger of soiling the cloth. Having a knowledge of bones and muscles, and all the conditions being favorable, the carver will be able to do his work scientifically, rapidly, and gracefully.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Realizing how much clearer a few pencil lines may make things than pages of written instruction, whenever it has seemed desirable the methods of carving a joint or a bird have been fully illustrated. As these ^ iu<span class="gstxt_sub">us</span>. illustrations are for real helps, and not for em- tratiomj if bellishment, the lines have been made as few, &quot;^Suei clear, and simple as possible, that there need be no doubt or confusion in the mind of the carver. If these illustrations are studied carefully, and if, in addition, the carver will study, in the chapter on &quot;Marketing,&quot; Figs. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16, the position of the bones and the direction of the muscles in the various cuts of butchers, meat will be clearly understood, and will aid the carver in knowing in what direction he should cut a joint, that the slice of meat may be cut across the grain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The four cuts showing the bones, muscles, and Why four mode of carving a shoulder of mutton are given g^^der of as a study of the complicated manner in which mutton are the muscles are arranged in this part of the do- <span class="gstxt_sup">glven</span>&#39; mestic animal. It would be an easy and valuable lesson to bone an uncooked shoulder of mutton. When purchasing this joint, ask the butcher not to bone it. With a sharp<span class='gtxt_body'>
knife pare off all the outer fat, leaving the lean bare. Then slip the knife between the bone and the flesh, beginning at the broad end of the shoulder-blade, and work down to the arm- and leg-bones. Remove the meat on the under side of the bone in the same manner. Examine the muscles to find the direction of each set.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>This piece of meat, when taken from a good fat animal, will contain thick layers of fat between the lean. Some of this may be removed, and the lean meat boiled, roasted, or braized. It is not as tender as some of the prime cuts, but it is very sweet and juicy.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>SOME SUGGESTIONS ABOUT CARVING</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There should be a long, broad-bladed knife for roast beef and other large joints; a smaller and narrow-bladed knife</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>for poultry and small joints. The fork should &#39;be&#39;used.<span class="gstxt_sup">0</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">nave</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> guard, which should be up while one is</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>carving. The knife must be examined and sharpened on the steel before it is used; this should be done before it is brought to the table.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In sharpening on the steel, be careful not to bear heavily on the knife, or to hold it at too sharp an angle. The best</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>way is to draw the knife under and over the steel, tosharpsn <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>t <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span>gl<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> o^ about fifteen or twenty degrees, a knife, drawing from the end of the knife near the handle</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>down to the point. The last strokes should be very slow and light, to even up the edge, if by chance it has become slightly turned.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Carving-knives should be ground once in a while. Unless you know how to do it yourself, or know of a good place where it may be done, ask your butcher to have it done for you. There is a French make of knife which is inexpensive and very satisfactory; they are called cooks, knives (the name of the maker is Sabatier). One can afford several sizes</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>of these knives, and they will be found invaluable. A French knife for carving poultry that solves the problem of joints for the inexperienced carver is called a disjointer or knifescissors. It is, however, too expensive for people of moderate means, the knife and fork in ebony handles costing fifteen dollars, and in ivory twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The carver&#39;s chair should be broad, firm, and Thecary</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>or s ch&amp;ir</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>high. There is no reason why any one should should be stand to carve. broad and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A joint or bird should not be garnished with anything that will interfere with the work of the Garnishcarver. Parsley, cress, and chevril may be put not&#39;interaside by the carver; therefore they are not objec- with tionable; but any substance that interferes with JSver. the work of carving is not advisable, no matter how decorative. It is impossible to carve easily on a small platter; it is well to have a plate on which the carver may put trimmings or bones that are not to be served.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Each joint or fowl should be so carved that if all is not required for one meal, it shall present a neat and attractive appearance the second day. Every slice or joint should be cut smoothly and neatly; a joint or fowl that has been hacked is unappetizing and wasteful.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Finish carving one side of a joint or fowl before beginning on the other side. When carving poultry, whether to ask the guests for their preference as to light or dark meat is a problem. Naturally, one wishes to TM <span class="gstxt_sub">a</span><span class="gstxt_sup">of</span> please every one at the table; but if, by chance guest&#39;s (and this often happens), the majority of the <span class="gstxt_sub">f</span>^<span class="gstxt_sub">r</span><span class="gstxt_sup">e</span>&#163;<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span>&quot;t<span class="gstxt_sup">C</span><span class="gstxt_sub">0</span><span class="gstxt_sup">e</span><span class="gstxt_sub">r</span> guests give a preference for one kind of meat, the dark meat, carver is in an embarrassing position. There was a time when one felt assured that the ladies would prefer light meat; but women have learned that dark meat is juicy and fine-flavored, and even the long-despised drumstick is now the first choice of many.</p>

When all the carving is done at the table the meat is hotter and the cracklings crisper than when it is cut in the kitchen; but, on the other hand, if the work in the kitchen is done rapidly and well, and the pig is served on a hot dish, there need be no great loss of heat or crispness, and the time of the carver is saved.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Roast Chicken.&#8212;A roast chicken is generally carved the same as in the directions for carving a turkey, except that the legs, not being so large, are not divided into so many parts. Sometimes the entire chicken is divided into joints. This is more difficult for the amateur, and more awkward for the guest, than when the meat is cut from the bones. If one wishes to serve a chicken in this manner, the carving is begun as indicated for a turkey. The legs, side-bones, and pope&#39;s nose are taken off; the first two joints of the wings only are removed. Cut straight down from this joint to the end of the breast-bone; separate these two long pieces from the shoulder-bone and any ligaments that may hold them. Separate the breast-bone from the back; cut this in two, separating it a little below the joint where the wishbone comes.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Roast Duck.&#8212;The method of carving varies with the custom of the house, and whether the fowl is domestic or wild. The wild fowl uses both legs and wings a great deal, thus making the joints tough and hard to &#39;Jjfb&quot;&quot;TM carve; while the domestic duck uses the legs much served in less, and the wings but rarely; therefore these joints are more tender than in the wild fowl. It wild duck, is the custom in many households to serve only the breast of the wild duck, reserving the legs, wings, and carcass for a salmi. In that case the duties of the carver are extremely simple.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In case the entire duck is served hot, it may be carved by either of the following methods:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Begin at the wing joint (a, Fig. 42), and cut off the wing, following the dotted line from <i>a </i>to <i>b. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Cut off the leg, following the dotted line <i>-ginst </i>from c to <i>d. </i>Press back the leg, and sever the method of thigh-bone from the back. This joint lies farther e^reduck back in the duck and goose than in the turkey or is served fowl. <span class="gstxt_sup">hot</span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Cut slices from the breast, following the dotted lines <i>e, e. </i>Begin at the lower part of the side, and work up to the ridge of the breast-bone. The slices should be cut slanting; if the knife is carried straight down it gives too narrow a slice.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. The side-bone will be found by inserting the knife at/, and following the dotted line.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The side-bone in the duck is short. (See Fig. 43, <i>d, d.) </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A good deal of rich, juicy meat will be found on the sides below the breast-bone. These portions are small, and cannot be cut in regular pieces like the breast, but they should be utilized by serving them with the breast.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The shoulder-blade will be found under the wings. The back may be divided into two parts, if it is to be served. If the duck is stuffed, make an opening in the apron near/, and serve the stuffing from here.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The food question is a complicated one, and in dealing with it one must look at its many sides: (1) cost; (2) nutritive value of different substances; (3) seasons; (4) climate; (5) age; (6) occupation; (7) eccentricities of taste and digestion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In providing food for any number of people, the object for which it is employed should be considered. Primarily the use of food is to supply material for the growth and repair of the animal body, and to give heat and vital force. Incidentally, among civilized humanity, it contributes largely to the social life.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Each meal should supply the proper elements for each of these requirements. Every housekeeper who would provide her family with food suitable for the maintenance of physical and mental vigor must know something of the principles of nutrition and digestion, and have some knowledge of the changes the raw materials undergo in cooking.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is claimed that the ordinary housekeeper has not time to study these subjects. It is almost the work of a lifetime to master any one of the sciences, but any intelligent woman may learn the essential principles underlying the science of nutrition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The market value of food materials does not, as a rule, indicate their nutritive value. For example, there is more nutrition in a pound of a flank of beef than <span class="gstxt_sub">V</span>aluedoes in a pound of tenderloin from the same animal; yet notindicate the tenderloin will cost three or four times as &quot;y^^<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span> much as the flank piece.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It must be remembered, however, that it often happens that food materials that are rich in nutritive qualities are difficult of digestion and require careful treatment to make them a satisfactory food.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The most important food principles have been divided by scientists into two general divisions, and these are again subdivided. The two great divisions are comprehended under nitrogenous compounds and carbon Compounds. pounds and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The nitrogenous compounds are absolutely ne- carbon cessary for the growth and repair of the living an- pounds, imal, and it is possible to live upon animal food alone. The carbon compounds give heat and force, but they alone cannot sustain life for any great length of time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The nitrogenous compounds include albumin, fibrin, and casein. Lean meat, eggs, milk, and fish are the sources from which we get nitrogenous foods in the most concentrated and digestible forms. Some vegetable substances are rich in nitrogen, while others are almost destitute of this important element.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The carbon compounds include starch, sugar, fats, etc. Although these foods are not absolutely essential to life, they are of great value in supplying heat and energy, and are less exciting and more economical food than all nitrogenous materials.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The digestive organs of a human being provide for the digestion of both carbon and nitrogenous compounds, so that nature designed that all these elements should ^o^<span class="gstxt_sup">17</span> enter into the nutrition of mankind. It is essenshould con- tial, then, that the daily menu should consist of a sist of a proper proportion of these two great divisions and portion of the phosphates and other inorganic salts and reat Sri <span class="gstxt_sup">water</span>.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'><span class="gstxt_sup">Bre</span>rions.<span class="gstxt_sup">V1</span>&quot; Nitrogenous Substances are composed of four elements&#8212;carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They are also known as proteid substances, because protoplasm enters into the composition of the cells of the organism. Another name by which they are known is albuminous substances, because they belong to the series of substances of which the white of egg is taken as a type. Sometimes, too, they are called flesh-like substances, because the muscles of the body are composed of these four elements. These explanations are for the young people, who are so often confused by the multiplicity of names for the same thing. Nitrogenous substances are flesh-formers. This term is often used in dietaries. In nature nitrogenous foods are nearly always mixed with other food principles. In animal foods there is always fat, various salts, and sometimes sulphur and phosphorus. The casein of milk, the vegetable casein of pease, beans, nuts, etc., and the gluten of flour all come under the head of albuminous or nitrogenous substances.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Carbon Compounds are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are divided into two classes&#8212;carbohydrates and hydrocarbons.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Carbohydrates are so called because the hydrogen and oxygen are in the right proportion to produce water. This division of the carbon compounds includes starch, dextrine, gum, and sugar.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Hydrocarbons.&#8212;The fats belong to this group. They</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE PROCESSES OF DIGESTION</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the selection, preparation, and serving of the food the housekeeper and cook have a serious duty to perform. It is not sufficient that enough of some sort of food be given; it must be of the right kind, properly prepared, and, so far as it lies in their power, served in such a manner that it shall appeal to the eye and palate.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The manner of preparing, serving, and eating food has a marked effect on the digestive organs. Every housekeeper and cook should have a clear understanding of Housewhen, where, and how each food principle is di- keeper and gested, that in cooking the combinations and pro- &quot;jJ^^J^ cesses shall be such that some of the organs shall knowledge</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:right;'>non.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>stomach is the overworked organ. The organs of digestion are the alimentary canal, and several sets of glands, which produce the digestive fluids.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Alimentary Canal consists of five parts&#8212;the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. There are four digestive fluids&#8212;saliva, gastric juice, bile, and pancreatic juice.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Saliva, which is formed in the mouth, acts on starch, changing some of it to sugar and dextrine.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Gastric Juice, which is produced by the lining membrane of the stomach, acts upon albuminous matter, and is thought not to act upon any other food principle.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Bile, which is one of the products of the liver, neutralizes the acidity of the partially digested food as it passes out of the stomach. It also acts upon the fats.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Pancreatic Juice.&#8212;This is the most important of the four digestive fluids, for it acts upon all the food principles.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The Process of Digestion is, briefly, this:</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. The food is ground to fine particles in the mouth, and in the process of mastication it is mixed with saliva, which acts on starch, but on no other substance. It is, however, a valuable aid in making the food pass through the esophagus with ease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. The food enters the stomach, and is rolled about by the muscular contraction of the coat of the stomach. In this way it is broken up, and every part brought in contact with the gastric juice.&#39; The gastric juice acts on albuminous matter, but on no other food principle. It dissolves the albumin in meat, bread, vegetables, etc., leaving the starch and fats free. Some of the perfectly digested food is absorbed in the stomach, but the greater portion passes into the small intestine in an acid, semi-liquid mass; this is called chyme.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. The bile and pancreatic juice mix with the chyme, converting the starch into sugar, the fats into a fine emulsion, and dissolve any albuminous substance that was not digested by the gastric juice. This new product is called chyle, and is absorbed by the villi, and so passes into the circulation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>From this brief sketch it will be seen that ^sit^of *&quot; thorough mastication is necessary, that the starch thorough may be acted upon by the saliva, and that the <span class="gstxt_sup">m</span>tion<span class="gstxt_sup">ca</span>&#39; shall be so finely divided that parts will sep</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>arate easily and the gastric juice may begin its legitimate work at once. When the food is not properly masticated the stomach<span class='gtxt_body'>
powers are wasted, in breaking it up, before the real work of digestion begins.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the preparation of food the fact must be kept in mind that the gastric juice acts only on albuminous matter. If fats, starch, and albumin are so intimately combined that the stomach powers are taxed with <i>jxlct&amp;cts </i>the task of separating them, it will be putting a only on alburden of work on this organ that will weaken it <span class="gstxt_sup">bu</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">ous</span> in time. It is for this reason that fried food, pastry, etc., are so difficult of digestion, especially when badly cooked. All albuminous food should be cooked so that the fibers are softened rather than hardened. Digestion</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Raw starch is hardly acted upon by the diges- of starch tive fluids, and passes out of the system nearly <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> the same as it entered. The more thoroughly it is cooked, the more easily it is digested.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fat that has not been cooked, or that was cooked at a low temperature, as, for example, butter, oils, the fat on boiled meats, etc., are easily digested, if not taken in too large a quantity. Filling the stomach with liquids while eating dilutes the gastric juice and so weakens its action on food.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Too much food in the stomach at once inter- Conditions feres with digestion. Excessive fatigue, anger, and unfaworry, anxiety, etc., all have a tendency to stop vorable to the flow of gastric juice, and hence interfere with d^<span class="gstxt_sup">68*1011,</span> digestion. It should be the duty and pleasure of every one to make the hours at table social, bright, and happy, and thus lay up a store of physical and mental health for the serious work of life.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>FRUITS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With the exception of nuts, the nutritive value of fresh fruits is not great, but as a regulator of the system they are exceedingly valuable. Dried fruits, like dried vegetables,<span class='gtxt_body'>
are richer in nutrients than the fresh, but they do not have the same refreshing powers that the fresh, juicy fruit has. Fruits, when eaten under-ripe or over-ripe, disarrange the digestive organs.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Nearly all fruits are best when allowed to ripen on the tree or vine. Pears are an exception to this.</p>

Fresh fruits differ in their effects upon the digestive organs. For most people pears, apples, plums, and grapes are a laxative, while peaches and strawberries have an opposite effect. These properties are very much modified by cooking. Except fruit be ripe enough, and not over-ripe, it is in a more healthful condition cooked.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>There are a few points in regard to fruits which every housekeeper should know.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Some fruits require very little sugar in cooking, while there are others that are very poor if a good deal of sugar is not used. Some of the fruits that require a tityofsugar <i>S<span class="gstxt_sup">00</span>&amp; </i>deal of sugar are strawberries, cranberries, and its plums, tart apples, currants, and gooseberries. &quot;fcritT The fruits that are better with only a very little or moderate amount of sugar are raspberries, blackberries, peaches, pears, quinces, etc. Nearly all fruits are of better color and flavor, and of a more tender texture, if the sugar is added when they are first put on to cook.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Hard fruits, such as quinces, must be made tender in clear water before the sugar is added. Some fruits will be improved by long cooking, while others would be spoiled by Method of t*&quot;<span class="gstxt_sup">s</span> P<span class="gstxt_sup">rocess&lt;</span> Fruits that will endure long, slow cooking cooking will not as a rule require as much sugar as those that must be cooked quickly. The dried fruits, such as peaches, apricots, and apples, if cooked long enough, will require very little sugar. Prunes should<span class='gtxt_body'>
never have sugar added to them. Wash all dried fruit carefully, and cover generously with cold water. Let it soak overnight. In the morning put it on to cook in the water in which it was soaked. Add the sugar, if any is used, and cook slowly two or more hours. A good way is to put the fruit and liquid in an earthen dish which can be covered. Bake in a very moderate oven.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The proportions of water and dried fruit are, to one pint of fruit one pint and a half of water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Prunes are better not soaked. Wash them one by one, then rinse in two more waters. Put them in a stew-pan, with a pint and a half of cold water to each pint of fruit. Let them simmer for two hours and a half. Turn them into a bowl, and set away to cool. They are delicious cooked in this manner.</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>PATS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Some fat is necessary to the maintenance of a perfectly healthy body. We get it in small quantities throughout the lean parts of meat, and in all good meat there is a generous layer of fat between the skin and the muscular parts. Some of this coating of fat should be left on the meat when it is put on to cook.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>I think that, as a rule, we do not attach enough importance to the temperature at which we cook fats, nor do we know enough about the temperature at which the different fats will burn or be so changed as to be <i>SSS^a </i>irritants in the digestive organs. temperaIt is safe to say that the lower the temperature ^^fats at which a fat can be cooked and have the flavor are cooked, developed, the more easily it will be digested. We all know how cooking changes the flavor of butter, several of the volatile acids which contribute to its flavor being broken up and driven off.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA230'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The flavor of the ordinary fats is improved by proper cooking; but if the temperature be raised too high, an irritating, fatty acid is developed, as witness the difference between a delicate brown, crisp piece of fat on a roast and the disagreeable acrid flavor of the fat which has been subjected to a high temperature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When there is water mixed with fat it cannot be raised to as high a temperature as if the fat were pure. It is for this reason that we put water in the dripping-pan, and mtagied baste the meat frequently with the mixture of with fat water and fat. This keeps the temperature of tempera.<span class="gstxt_sup">6</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">sur</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">ace</span> of *<span class="gstxt_sup">ne</span> pi<span class="gstxt_sup">ece</span> of meat lower than it turelow. would otherwise be, and the digestibility of the roast is infinitely greater than it would be if it were basted with the clear hot fat that dropped from the meat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In all kitchens more or less frying is done, and it is important that it should be done properly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Putting a substance to cook in a pan with half an inch or more of fat is the most unhealthful and extravagant mode of cooking. The portions of the food that are easily, <i>eco- </i>exposed to a current of air are kept at such a low nomieally, temperature that they absorb the fat. <span class="gstxt_sup">M</span>{u&#163;y!<span class="gstxt_sup">th</span>&quot; <span class="gstxt_sup">To</span> fry economically, healthfully, and with the least possible amount of work, it is necessary to have fat enough to immerse the article. Then, too, it is essential that you know the qualities of the fats and make a proper selection; and, again, that you know the temperature at which different articles cook and at which the different fats burn.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The purer the fat&#8212;that is to say, the more oil there is in it&#8212;the higher the degree to which it can be raised without burning.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Butter burns at the lowest temperature, and olive-oil at the highest.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Here is a table of the burning-points of the fats most commonly employed for frying purposes:</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Lard 392&#176;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Olive-oil 608&#176;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It will be seen from this table that butter is the poorest material, and olive-oil the best, for frying purposes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Butter can, by clarifying, be made to stand a higher temperature than 266&#176;. This is done by heating the butter slowly, skimming it, and letting it rest on the fire until the casein has coagulated and fallen to the Parity bottom, then pouring off the clear oily substance. butter. The French prepare their butter in this manner for sautering and frying. Salt raises the temperature and causes the butter to burn. It should be washed out of butter that is to be used in sautering or frying. The French mix lard with butter for frying purposes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It will be seen that, next to butter, the suet from beef, mutton, and veal burns at a low temperature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Drippings, because they are the most liquid parts of the fats of roasted and boiled meats, have a larger proportion of oil than either suet or butter, and therefore burn at a higher temperature. A combination of drippings and lard is the most satisfactory. Many persons object to lard on the score of its being a product of pork; but it is certainly more healthful for frying purposes than the suets, because it can be heated to a higher temperature, searing the article at once, and thus giving a food comparatively free from grease.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In heating fat for frying, one must always consider the<span class='gtxt_body'>
nature of the article to be fried.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>This is especially true of fish, because some of the water escapes into the fat during the cooking.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When frying fish, fish-balls, egg-plant, or any watery article, it will generally be found that after the second batch has been cooked the fat will be full of bubbles of steam, and will no longer fry an article crisp and brown. The fat must be kept hot until every particle of water has evaporated. Then it will do its work as well as ever.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If one attempts to fry in fat that is saturated with water, the product will be a grease-soaked article, which is not fit for the stomach of man or beast.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>4. If there is a good deal of foreign substance in it, add two or three raw potatoes cut in slices.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The fat from bacon, ham, and sausages can be used for frying potatoes and hominy. These fats can be used instead of butter in some of the savory sauces made for vegetables.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fat from mutton, lamb, turkey, duck, and goose goes into the soap-grease, being too strong-flavored to use in cooking.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is well to have a cake of mutton tallow to use on chapped hands and on rusted articles, and also to save a bottle of clear goose-oil to use in case of sickness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All fats used for frying should be thoroughly clarified. To clarify fat, keep it at a gentle heat until there is not a bubble to be seen, and all sediment has fallen to the bottom, leaving a clear oil.

Set in a cold place. When the fat has formed in a cake on top of the water, take off and put into the frying-pan. Heat gently, and cook until it has ceased to bubble and the sediment has fallen to the bottom. Partially cool, and strain. Remember that as<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE COOKING OF ALBUMINOUS SUBSTANCES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Albuminous matter is of various kinds, and is found in animal and vegetable substances. In their natural condition some of the albumins are liquid, some are solid, and there are others that have a consistency between the two.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Coagulation is one of the properties of albumin. Different kinds of albumin solidify under different conditions, but heat has the power of coagulating nearly all albuminous The coagii- <span class="gstxt_sub">su</span>bstances.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>albumin. Only a small portion of the casein of milk coagulates when subjected to heat; but if the milk be heated to 100&#176; and an acid is added, it will coagulate, as is the case when we make rennet custard. This solidified mass will be soft, creamy, and digestible.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>added, the albumin will be coagulated, but the product will be quite different from that obtained by adding the acid to the milk at 100&#176;. The higher temperature hardens the albumin, which separates from the water, thus giving a curd and whey. The longer the cooking is continued at this high temperature, the tougher the curd will become, and the clearer the whey.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fibrin in the blood coagulates on exposure to the air, and also when subjected to heat. The albumin in lean meat and in the white of an egg coagulates on exposure to heat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Albuminous substances, when cooked at a temperature below the boiling-point, will be soft and digestible. When cooked at a temperature of 212&#176; or higher, the albumin becomes hard and indigestible. The purer the albumin, the more marked is this condition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To illustrate this, we will take milk and eggs. When we make a curd and whey, we always find that the curd made with skim-milk is much tougher than that made <span class="gstxt_sub">Milk</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">and</span> with whole milk; if a little cream is added to the eggs taken milk the curd will be still softer. Thus cheese <span class="gstxt_sup">to</span>^^^<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> made with skim-milk is hard; that made with tomperawhole milk is richer and softer; and that made Jjjjj^&quot; with whole milk and some cream is still softer.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>We boil an egg hard, and break it up. The white will be hard and horny, while the yolk will be light and crumbly. The white of an egg is almost pure albumin, while the yolk contains nearly twice as much fatty matter as it does albumin; hence it does not harden into a solid mass like the white.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Albuminous substance in lean meat is always mixed with fatty matter, and the more fat there is, the less hard will become the albumin when exposed to a high temperature. It must be remembered, however, that the fat in the yolk of an egg and in milk is in the form of an emulsion, while in lean meat it is in separate layers.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The effect of cooking upon meat is to coagulate the albumin and fibrin, and to gelatinize the tendons and connective tissue, and it also develops flavor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Two other characteristics of albuminous matter are the tendencies to fermentation and putrefaction.

I speak of this matter now, so that when the question of slow cooking comes up, it may be fully understood that it must not be too slow.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The effect of heat on albuminous as on all other substances is not only to effect a change in the texture, but also in the flavor. As a rule, the higher the temperature, the more pronounced the flavor. This development of flavor is quite important, as it makes the food more appetizing, and one should aim to cook at such a temperature that the best flavors shall be developed, and yet that the albuminous substance shall not be made hard and indigestible.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Put the third egg in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil for ten minutes. Then open all three eggs and put them on a plate. Examine the texture, then taste for the flavor, using butter and salt, if you like. All three eggs were cooked ten minutes. One stood after a few seconds with a temperature of 190&#176;, which continued to lower until the egg was removed from the water. The white of this egg is a thick, soft curd, the yolk very liquid. There is not much flavor, except a suggestion of rawness. The second egg, that was dropped into the boiling water which fell after a few seconds to a temperature of 200&#176;, has a pleasanter flavor, the white is firmer, but it breaks up into a soft mass under slight pressure; the yolk is slightly thickened. This is an ideally soft-cooked egg. The third egg, which went into the boiling water and boiled all the time (212&#176;), is what is commonly called a hard-boiled egg. The white is a smooth, hard mass; being almost pure albumin, there is nothing to keep its particles soft when exposed to the temperature of boiling water. The yolk of the egg is firm and mealy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This experiment teaches us (1) that pure albumin coagulates at a low temperature (the average is about 165&#176;), but that little flavor is developed; (2) that at a little higher temperature (average about 180&#176;) the albumin, although a little firmer, is still soft and digestible, and is better flavored; (3) that when cooked at a temperature of 212&#176; or more the albumin becomes hard, horny, and indigestible.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If all albuminous substances which we cook were as free from admixtures as the white of egg, we could say that the temperature for cooking should be 180&#176;. But we have few substances which are thus pure.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All boiled or stewed meats should be cooked at this temperature. This rule applies to all salted meats, such as beef, pork, hams, tongues, etc., all fresh meats, poultry, and fish.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In roasting, broiling, braizing, etc., all meats should be cooked as near as possible at the simmering temperature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is important, however, that fresh meat or poulruieB for ^ <span class="gstxt_sup">snou</span>^ be hardened on the surface, that the roasting, juices may be retained in the meat. To do this broiling there must be a high temperature at first. As etc.&#39; soon as a thin crust is formed the temperature</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>should be lowered. All animal and vegetable food is more healthful when cooked in such a manner that some of the gases which are formed in cooking may pass off; therefore the stew-pans should never be covered closely.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In roasting, the piece of meat should never rest on the bottom of the pan. A steel or wire rack should be placed in the pan, and the meat should rest on this. Meat should never be basted with the clear hot fat that drops into the pan; a piece of meat that has been saturated in this manner with hot fat must be indigestible. Always have a little water in the pan to mingle with the drippings. The water keeps the temperature of the fat low, and meat cooked in an oven is improved by being basted with such a mixture. If the<span class='gtxt_body'>
foregoing principles are fully understood, and the following general rules are followed, one can be sure of having all animal food as tender and succulent as the quality of the meat will admit.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Boiled Meats.&#8212;Put the piece of meat or poultry into boiling water, and boil rapidly fifteen or twenty minutes; then place the stew-pan where the water will bubble gently until the meat is done. The time of cooking depends upon the kind of meat, the toughness, etc. Fresh beef, when required to be well done, should cook about five hours; corned beef, tongue, ham, five hours. Should the piece of beef or ham weigh over ten or twelve pounds, allow an extra hour; it will take an hour for the heat to penetrate to the center of a large, solid piece of meat. For fresh meat that is to be served rare, like mutton and beef, the time depends upon the shape; a thin piece requires less time than a thick piece. A leg of mutton weighing ten pounds will be cooked rare in an hour and a half; medium well done in two hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fowl not very old will cook in an hour and a half; but a tough one may take two or three hours. A turkey weighing ten pounds should cook three hours and a half.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The cover of the saucepan should be drawn a little to one side, all through the cooking, to allow the escape of steam and gases.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Hams, tongues, corned beef, and poultry, that are not to be served hot, are all improved by partially cooling in the water in which they were boiled. The saucepan must be set in a cool place (in a current of air, if possible), and the cover must be removed.

This must be taken into account when cooking in the oven, or before, over, or under the fire. It would not be possible to roast perfectly in an oven that registered 202&#176;. The temperature should be about 350&#176; when the meat is first put in. As soon as the meat is browned on all sides the temperature should be lowered by the closing of the drafts, and, if need be, the opening of the checks; but, as a rule, the closing of the drafts will be sufficient. Basting the meat frequently with the drippings in the pan will drive the heat to the center and make the meat juicy.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Broiling.&#8212;The same principle must be applied to broiling as to roasting: first great heat to sear the surface, then slow cooking. A steak or chop cut an inch thick should cook for two minutes close to the fire, then eight minutes drawn a little distance from the fire. The meat must be turned frequently. This time and method give a steak or chop of medium rareness.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Stewing and Braizing.&#8212;All meats stewed and braized should be treated like boiled meats: first great heat, then a gentle simmering.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Prying.&#8212;The least objectionable and most economical method of frying is to immerse the article to be cooked in a bath of hot fat. Frying is the least healthful of all methods of cooking, and should be employed sparingly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fish.&#8212;The principles underlying the cooking of meats are the same for fish. Salt fish should <i>never boil. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Mutton should always have the thin skin that comes next to the fat removed before cooking, as this is what gives the strong, disagreeable flavor to the meat.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE COOKING OP VEGETABLE <br/>                  SUBSTANCES <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The vegetable foods are divided into four general classes &#8212;cereals, legumes, tubers, and green vegetables.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Cereals,&#8212;Under this head are included all the grains&#8212; wheat, oats, rye, barley, Indian corn, rice, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Legumes.&#8212;Pease, beans, and lentils belong to this class.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Tubers.&#8212;To this class belong potatoes, turnips, carrots, beets, parsnips, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Green Vegetables.&#8212;The leaves, stalks, and green, tender pods of vegetables come under this head.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Vegetable Fruits and Flowers.&#8212;Cucumbers, squash, eggplant, tomatoes, etc., are sometimes called vegetable fruit. The flowers of some vegetables, such as cauliflower and French artichoke, are the parts of the vegetable used.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Vegetables vary in their composition, some having a large proportion of water, while in others it is small. In green and moist vegetables the percentage of water is high. In the cereals and legumes it is low.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Starch goes to make up a large percentage of some vegetables, while others contain none. All the cereals, legumes, potatoes, etc., belong to the first class. Carrots, _ turnips, onions, Jerusalem artichokes, beets, and biestnatdo tomatoes belong to the second class. In nearly and do not all the plants that contain starch there is also starch&quot; found a slight trace of dextrine. Small as is the amount of dextrine, it exercises an influence on the flavor of properly cooked starchy foods.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The starch in a plant consists of granules, which are enveloped in a thin membrane. No matter how fine the flour may be, a large proportion of the starch grains are still protected by this membrane, which must be broken before the real cooking of the starch begins. Moisture and a high<span class='gtxt_body'>
temperature are necessary to the perfect cooking of starch. Potatoes, green corn, and other moist vegetables supply the moisture for cooking their starch; but the dry cereals and legumes must be supplied with the necessary moisture. The effect of heat on starch is to swell the grains, causing them to burst through their thin sacks. A good illustration of this is pop-corn.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If there is a plenty of moisture the starch grains absorb it, as, for example, when a starchy substance is first put into a boiling liquid it begins to thicken immediately, cooking on P<span class="gstxt_sup">rov</span>*ded th<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> substance is ground fine, as in the starch. case of corn-starch; if the cooking is continued for twenty minutes or half an hour, with the cover on the stew-pan to prevent evaporation, the mixture grows thinner rather than thicker&#8212;that is, the starch becomes dissolved and grainy; when subjected to long cooking at a high temperature, a portion of the starch is changed into dextrine, then sugar&#8212;hence the sweeter taste in wellbaked bread or any starchy substance when subjected to long cooking at a high temperature. Some kinds of starch become more transparent than others when cooked; this is notably the case with arrowroot.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When starch is subjected to a temperature of 320&#176; or more, some portion of it is changed to dextrine, and this, in turn, is changed to sugar, if the cooking is continued long enough, under the right conditions. For example, when we make a cream sauce by first cooking flour in hot fat, and then adding milk to it, if the sauce is used at once it will be smooth and free from a sweet taste; but let it cook for some time, and it becomes sweet, as if sugar had been added to it. When there is a trace of dextrine in the starchy food, as is the case in wheat, potatoes, etc., the long cooking changes the dextrine to sugar, thus giving a peculiar nutty flavor to bread, mush, and vegetables.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The digestive juices have little action on starch in the raw<span class='gtxt_body'>
state; if taken into the system in that form, it causes derangement of the alimentary canal, and the greater part passes out unchanged. So it is very important that this substance be properly cooked, that it may be palatable and digestible.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'><span style='font-variant:small-caps;'>Note.&#8212;</span>Church says: &quot;It has been found that uncooked starch from Indian corn may be completely turned into sugar by the action of the saliva in 3 minutes, oat-starch in 6 minutes, wheat-starch in 40 minutes, and potato-starch in 3 hours, the quantities, etc., being the same in each case. But after thorough cooking, all starches require nearly the same time.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Flour, corn-starch, etc., cook much quicker than the coarser meals. This is because the starchy particles are broken up so much finer that the heat and moisture reach them quickly. It is for this reason that Graham bread must cook so much longer than the loaf made with fine wheat flour. A mush or gruel made with fine flour will cook in much less time than that made with the coarser meals.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All cereals should be stirred into boiling water, and they should boil. Salt should not be added at first, because it hardens the cellulose or woody envelops. When cooking starchy foods it is important that one should know what result is desired at the end of the process. For example, do we want the article cooked just long enough to swell and burst the starch granules, or do we want the process to go further and change the character of the article from a comparatively light, dry mass to a moist, gummy one?</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>We have seen that the first effect of heat on Conditions the starch granules is to make them swell and <span class="gstxt_sup">w</span>^<span class="gstxt_sub">e</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">ro</span>&quot; burst through their envelop. When we cook po- light, dry, tatoes, rice, pop-corn, dumplings, etc., the aim is <span class="gstxt_sup">or</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">moist</span>, to have these dishes light and dry; therefore the <span class="gstxt_sup">6U</span>ticie.<span class="gstxt_sup">ar</span> cooking should stop as soon as the starch granules have burst. If the cooking continues in moisture, the starch<span class='gtxt_body'>
absorbs the moisture and the article becomes soggy and heavy. If, on the contrary, we want the starch to dissolve, we cook it a long time in plenty of liquid, as when we bake a little rice and a great deal of milk together for two or three hours. The result is a thick, creamy, delicious mass.</span></p>

In the form of properly made and baked bread, wheat gives one of the most healthful and satisfying nutriments. There are hundreds of methods of making bread, and the different forms and textures give a pleasant variety; but taken day after day and year after year, there is no form of bread which is so satisfactory as the loaf that is made with flour, water, salt, yeast, and possibly a little butter to make it tender, and also a little sugar to help fermentation. A tablespoonful of sugar to four quarts of flour will be sufficient for this. The fermentation should go on only long enough to make the bread so light as to break up readily in mastication. The loaves should be in such a form that the heat will penetrate to the center readily and quickly, and each loaf should be baked long enough to cook the starch thoroughly and give a rich brown, nutty-flavored crust. The secret of the French bread lies in the fact that the dough is worked without the use of much dry flour; it is not allowed to rise much; the loaves give as much crust as crumb, and they are baked in well-ventilated brick ovens until a rich, thick crust is formed. However, the French loaf is good only the first or second day; this is because the kneading is not enough to make the dough smooth and fine-grained. The more dough is kneaded, the finer and closer grained will be the loaf; the bread will be more tender and will keep soft longer than a loaf which has had but little kneading.</p>

Pease, when dried, require long, slow cooking, but when fresh-picked will cook quickly. Lentils require about the same treatment as dried beans. The dried beans and pease, pound for pound, are much richer in food values than the fresh vegetables, but require great care in cooking, that the tough skin may be made tender.

Some have a good deal of sugar and no starch, while others, as the potato, contain a great deal of starch. All these vegetables should be washed very clean, and pared or scraped. If potatoes are liked cooked in their &quot;jackets,&quot; they should be pared at the ends, and a narrow strip of the skin taken from the middle of the potato. This is to allow the gases to escape. Baked potatoes, if pierced when half done with a sharp fork or skewer, will be more digestible than if an outlet were not made for the gases to escape.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Carrots, parsnips, and salsify should always be scraped, never pared. In old carrots the heart is hard and woody, and unfit for food; only the tender outside layer should be used. In new carrots the heart is tender, and should be used. It is important that all these vegetables should be cooked until tender, but no longer. Over-cooking causes them to become strong-flavored and indigestible.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Green Vegetables.&#8212;Green vegetables have not the nutritive value found in the grains and most of the tubers, but they are valuable because of the phosphates and other salts and acids which they contain, and which the human body demands. They also fill an important part in the human economy by supplying a food which dilutes, as it were, the more highly concentrated foods, such as meats, fish, eggs, etc. If it were not for the use of the vegetables, we should eat too much of the more stimulating foods. Finally, the variety which they supply to our tables is one of their chief blessings.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fresh vegetables require great care in their preparation, that they may be made digestible, and yet retain the greater How the P<span class="gstxt_sup">art</span> of ^eir <span class="gstxt_sup">mmera</span>l constituents. The French French people are much more scientific in their prepara<span class="gstxt_sup">eook</span> ^<span class="gstxt_sup">sh</span> tion of fresh and green vegetables than we are.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Where it is possible, they cook them in very little or no water. They blanch nearly all green vegetables before<span class='gtxt_body'>
proceeding with the cooking proper. This is done to remove any strong or bitter taste, and to make green vegetables greener, and the white or light tubers whiter.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The vegetables are cleaned, well washed, and drained. They are then put into a stew-pan full of boiling water, and boiled for more or less time, depending upon the vegetable. The vegetable is then poured into a <span class="gstxt_sup">How</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">the</span>y colander, and cold water is poured over it. Then blanched, the cooking proceeds. Usually spinach, lettuce, sorrel, etc., are put in a thin piece of cloth, and the water is pressed from them. They are then put back on the fire, with butter and seasonings and sometimes a little bouillon, and are simmered gently until done&#8212;spinach about half an hour.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For such vegetables as carrots, turnips, celery, onions, etc., a sauce is often made in which they are simmered. Sometimes these vegetables are first glazed, that is, fried in butter until brown; then a little sugar is added, and they are cooked a few minutes longer. This gives a rich-flavored and savory vegetable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Many of the tuberous vegetables, when new and fresh, are cooked without any liquid. The small new potato is pared and washed, then put in a broad-bottomed stewpan, with butter or some other fat, and cooked vegetables, over a moderate fire until done. The new potatoes, which are about the size of a large marble, cook in about twelve or fifteen minutes; the stew-pan is often shaken to turn the potatoes. Young carrots are cooked in the same manner, except that they are sliced, and butter, sugar, and salt are added to them. It is a delicious dish, and extremely healthy. Turnips are cooked in the same manner. Young green pease are cooked with tender leaves of lettuce, salt, pepper, butter, and sugar. Small white onions and fine herbs are sometimes cooked with them. When the pease are not so tender, or are canned, a little water or bouillon is added to them, barely enough to cover them.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The French cook uses a great deal of butter in the cooking of vegetables. Sometimes sweet drippings are substituted, and, again, a little fresh pork is employed. The most delicious soups are made with a combination of vegetables, herbs, water, butter or other fat, and salt and pepper. There is hardly a vegetable which is not used, either cooked or raw, in salad, the usual dressing being one third or fourth vinegar, and two thirds or three fourths oil, with, of course, salt and pepper. For the bean salads, mustard is sometimes used. When it is possible, the French housekeeper has her little dish of garniture for her salad, which consists of <i>cerfeuil </i>(chervil), parsley, <i>ciboule </i>(a young onion), and tarragon. This garniture is added to the vegetables before the oil and vinegar.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is not possible to give the exact time for cooking fresh vegetables, because so much depends upon the vegetable itself, the time it has been picked, the degree of Jookinif maturity, and whether it grew quickly or slowly, green We all know that in cold seasons asparagus and somewha? corn are both hard and unsatisfactory, for these dependent two vegetables demand quick growth to be ten</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>nesfand de<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span>&#39; I<span class="gstxt_sup">n</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">a</span> ^ <span class="gstxt_sup">season</span> pe<span class="gstxt_sup">ase</span>, beans, and nearly tenderness, all the green vegetables are rather hard and tough.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>The slow growth that comes from a cold season makes these vegetables also less tender. Vegetables that have been picked long enough to wilt will not be tender unless the freshness and crispness have been restored by the use of cold water. Lettuce and asparagus can be kept fresh by standing the root ends in a pan of cold water. All herbs should have the stem ends placed in cold water. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, string-beans, spinach, and other green vegetables can be made crisp and fresh by soaking in cold water for several hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All fresh vegetables should be perfectly crisp before being put into boiling water. The water should be boiling<span class='gtxt_body'>
when fresh vegetables are put into it, and kept boiling gently all the time the vegetable is cooking. If the stewpan is only partially covered, the vegetables will be greener and of better flavor than if covered condition of closely. Too long cooking darkens the vegetable fresh vegeand makes it strong-flavored. Turnips, cabbage, <i>will </i>and cauliflower are good examples of this. The cooking, small white turnip or cauliflower cooked over thirty over-cookminutes immediately begins to take on color and ing ruins a flavor; and if the cooking is extended to double <span class="gstxt_sub">ve</span>g^ble that time, as is often the case, by careless people, the vegetable becomes indigestible. If potatoes are cooked two or three minutes after they are done, particularly if they are surrounded by moisture, either of their own or from some other source, they begin to grow soggy and strong-flavored. As great care is demanded that the vegetable should not be over-cooked as that it is not under-cooked.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The supply and quality of our vegetables improve each year. Market-gardeners make a better selection of seeds, and bestow more care on the cultivation and marketing of vegetables, than was their custom. Small, almost stringless beans and fresh carrots are to be found in the markets all the year, where formerly they were to be had only a few months in the year.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A few definite rules will serve to show how easy, healthful, and satisfactory is the scientific method of cooking vegetables of the various classes. If the housekeeper and <span class="gstxt_sub">Apleafor</span> cook will take the time to thoroughly study and more atunderstand the principles underlying the cooking ^&#176; of vegetable substances as given in this chapter, ration of our tables will be served with savory, digestible <span class="gstxt_sup">v</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>&#39; vegetables every day in the year. I feel like asking, as a personal favor, that each housekeeper will give for one year as much time to the study of vegetables as she ordinarily gives to the study of cakes, pastry, and other sweets.</p>

Put them in a stew-pan with the butter, sugar, salt, and stock or water; let them cook rapidly, with the cover off the stew-pan, for ten minutes. For one quart of beans, use (after they are blanched) two tablespoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, and half a pint of light meat stock or of water. Or the water may be omitted, and a third tablespoonful of butter added; cook over a very hot fire for five minutes; this gives glazed beans. Or they may be heated and served in a white or brown sauce. If a tablespoonful of salt is added to the water in which the beans are boiled, they will be greener, but not quite so delicate and tender.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The beans may be boiled hours, or a day, before the time of serving. The important thing to remember is that they must be chilled as soon as they are taken from the fire.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Spinach, lettuce, sorrel, cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, carrots, parsnips, and like vegetables may all be cooked in boiling water, chilled in cold water, drained, and put away until serving-time, when they may be heated and served in sauce, or sautered with the butter and salt, as directed for beans. The sugar may be omitted from beans and other vegetables, if not liked.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The secret of success in this cooking is in having the vegetable crisp, put into boiling water, having it boil continuously, with the cover of the stew-pan partially removed to allow the escape of gases, and the rapid and thorough<span class='gtxt_body'>
chilling of the vegetable as soon as it is taken from the boiling water.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If a vegetable is to be served immediately, the chilling is not necessary. If the vegetable is to be served in a sauce, the water in which it is boiled must be salted, as the sauce should not be salt enough to season the vegetable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Boiled Potatoes.&#8212;Have the potatoes pared, or partially pared; cover them with boiling water, and let them cook, with the cover of the stew-pan partially off, for thirty minutes. Add one tablespoonful of salt for every dozen potatoes. At the end of thirty minutes drain off every drop of water; set the stew-pan on the range for a few minutes to dry off the potatoes. Never put the cover over the cooked vegetable. If the potatoes must wait before serving, cover them with several folds of cheese-cloth, and let the stew-pan stand on a warm part of the range. The cheese-cloth allows the moisture to escape, and yet protects the vegetable from the cold air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Boiled Eice.&#8212;Wash the rice, rubbing the grains between the hands, in three waters. Put it on to cook in boiling water (two quarts of water to half a pint of rice). Add one tablespoonful of salt; boil rapidly, with the cover off the stew-pan, for fifteen minutes; turn the rice into a colander to drain. Immediately return it to the stew-pan, which cover and set back where it will keep hot for forty minutes or longer. Rice cooked in this manner will be sweet, dry, and have every grain separate.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The rice may be boiled in the water for thirty instead of fifteen minutes, in which case it must be thoroughly drained, then placed in the stew-pan on the back of the range; cover with cheese-cloth to allow the steam to escape.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By the first method the rice is only partially cooked when the water is drained off. The saucepan is then covered closely to prevent the escape of the moisture, which is required to finish the cooking of the vegetable. By the second method<span class='gtxt_body'>
the rice absorbs all the water it requires in the thirty minutes; therefore it must be thoroughly drained, and while drying off it must be covered with a coarse cloth, or with cheesecloth, that the steam may escape.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>These examples of cooking potatoes and rice are given to show how necessary it is that there be only the required amount of moisture when a starchy substance is to be cooked dry. On the other hand, when a starchy substance is desired moist, the cooking must be done in plenty of moisture and at a high temperature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In cooking the various cereals in the form of ^Matare&quot; mush, they should always be stirred into the redevelops quired amount of boiling water, and boil for at to cereal^ l<span class="gstxt_sup">east</span> te<span class="gstxt_sup">n</span> minutes.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In preparing certain mixtures the manner of combining and manipulating materials is very important. A few brief statements will help the housekeeper and cook to understand the reason why one gets such different results from the same materials under varying manipulations and conditions.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Doughs.&#8212;These are a mixture of flour or meal, liquids, and other materials. Anything that is made so thick that it can be molded into various forms is a dough. The more thoroughly a dough is kneaded or beaten, makes the finer grained will be the article made from it. <span class="gstxt_sub">u</span> ^*&#167;ne The less moisture there is in dough, the drier and grained, more crumbly will be the cooked article.

<p class='gtxt_body'>dough mixtures depend for their lightness on carbonic-acid gas, air, and moisture. The heat applied in cooking expands the gas, the air, and the moisture which has been changed to steam. The more air we beat into a dough, the less carbonic-acid gas will be required to make it light. In cooking, because of the greater pressure required to force the solid particles apart, all doughs, except where yeast has been used, require a greater heat than do the batters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Batters. &#8212;Mixtures of flour, meal, liquid, and other substances that are too thin to be molded into shape, are termed batters. Like doughs, they depend for lightness on air, moisture, and sometimes carbonic-acid gas. The thicker the batter, the greater the force required to push the particles apart.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The carbonic-acid gas which we employ to make doughs and batters light is produced in several ways. One is by fermentation, as when we mix yeast with the dough or batter; as the mixture ferments, particles of ^JJ^^<span class="gstxt_sup">f</span> gas are given off, which become entangled in the acid gas. dough, filling it with cells, and causing it to expand as a dry sponge does when placed in water. It is important that the dough be thoroughly kneaded or beaten, that the gas may be evenly distributed, thus giving a finecelled loaf of bread, roll, or muffin. Articles of food that are made light with yeast must have all the cells formed, and the fermentation nearly finished, before heat is applied, because a high temperature kills the yeast plant and so stops fermentation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Carbonic-acid gas may be produced at the moment it is required for use by a combination of an acid, an alkali, and a liquid, as in the case of soda and cream of tartar or bakingpowder; or with an alkali and an acid liquid, as, for example, soda and sour milk, vinegar, lemon-juice, molasses, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The cook should remember that the gas is liberated at once when the wet acid and alkali are combined, except in the</p>

This may be proved by putting equal quantities of baking-powder in two tumblers, and pouring a little cold water over one, and hot water over the other. The second glass will be filled immediately with the gas. This illustration goes to show that, to get the full quantity of the gas entangled in the dough or batter, all the materials should be cold during the mixing, and that the temperature to which the article is subjected while cooking should be moderate if a fine-grained, even-celled muffin or cake is desired; and if, on the other hand, one wishes an article filled with large cells the temperature should be higher.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When using soda and sour milk, lemon-juice, vinegar, and like acids, everything should be in readiness, and as much as possible of the mixing and beating should be done before the acid and alkali are combined. The work should progress very rapidly after this, or a great deal of the gas will escape into the air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>* The cook should not depend wholly upon chemicals for making her dough and batter light. Where there is plenty of air entangled, only a small amount of carbonic acid will be required. The too generous use of baking-powder produces a dry, tasteless bread, muffin, or cake.</p>

The value of eggs in making a substance light is not that of <span class="gstxt_sub">How</span> ^ themselves they have this power, but that the why eggs albumin in the egg is a tenacious substance, capa- ^g^^TM ble of stretching and entangling a great volume of air. The albumin hardens at a low temperature, thus insuring the stability of the walls of the cells, a most important thing in delicate batters, like muffins and cake.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The temperature at which doughs and batters are baked has much to do with the texture of the finished article.

The same batter, if it had been cooked in a moderate oven, would have been evenly filled with fine cells; the texture would have been delicate and tender. If a batter is very thin, as, for example, sponge-cake or angelcake, the heat must be very moderate. If the oven is too hot, the cake rises rapidly and then falls; that is, the walls of the cells expand too rapidly to hold the structure, and a collapse is the result, as is the case in making soap-bubbles when one blows too hard&#8212;the bubble bursts.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A good general rule for baking batters and doughs is to have a very moderate oven for the thinnest batters, increasing the heat as the batters thicken, until we come General to bread, which requires a rather hot oven.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the preparation of food, while it is important that we preserve, as much as possible, all the nutrition in the substance, it is quite as essential that we cook the food in the most digestible manner, even if this means a slight loss in nutrition.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>We have seen how temperature affects albuminous and carbon compounds, and we have also seen the importance of the proper manipulation of the food materials, followed by the proper application of heat. There is another point which has not received from investigators the attention which it deserves; this is, What are the effects of retaining in the food all the odors and flavors that are developed and liberated in the cooking?

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All food materials contain flavoring substances, more or less strong, that are fully developed by heat. In the starchy foods the flavors and odors are mild, while <span class="gstxt_sub">M</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">and</span> in green vegetables, as a rule, both flavors and flavors odors are pronounced. This is particularly true <span class="gstxt_sup">d</span>&#163;<span class="gstxt_sup">ve</span>jJ&#176;<span class="gstxt_sub">a</span>t<span class="gstxt_sup">d</span> of vegetables that contain a good deal of sulphur or a pungent essential oil, as, for example, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, turnips, carrots, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With the exception of starchy foods, all vegetable and animal substances that are cooked in <i>closed </i>vessels are difficult of digestion. The same foods thoroughly ventilated while cooking will have a delicate co^gla flavor and be easy of digestion&#8212;provided, of dosed or course, that all the other conditions for proper ^/vessels&quot; cooking are observed. Take, for example, cabbage, turnips, string-beans, or cauliflower. Cook them in plenty of boiling water for half an hour, having the water boiling all the while, and the cover partially off the saucepan, and it will be found that these vegetables will have a delicate flavor, and will not disagree with those who partake of them. On the other hand, cook them for the same length of time with the saucepan covered, and the flavor will be strong, and in most cases they will cause flatulence. By boiling with the cover off the stew-pan, a part of the gases which produce the strong flavor and odor are carried off in the steam, thus making the vegetable much more delicate and digestible. This will be found true in the cooking of all vegetables, meats, and fish. No matter what the process of cooking is, let there be thorough ventilation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Another point to remember in regard to heat, if Loss of you would have a fine-flavored vegetable, soup, h^red meat, cup of coffee or tea, is that after the ar- temperaticle has been raised to a certain temperature, it <span class="gstxt_sup">tnre</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Economy does not mean going without things that are necessary to health and happiness, but a wise selection and preparation of materials. It means that everyeconomy. thing is put to its proper use, and there is no waste. The great difficulty in the ordinary family is that we have too many kinds of food for one meal, and that there is neither the time nor the skill to prepare so many things in the best manner. Fewer things simply and perfectly cooked and served would mean greater economy, better health, and greater refinement in the table.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The housekeeper should study to get the right combinations for health, growth, and repair. No one food substance, Proper <span class="gstxt_sup">exce</span>Pt milk, contains all the elements necessary combina- to growth and repair, heat and force. Milk as a</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Eggs in almost any form are a valuable and economical food. Milk and eggs, however, have a tendency to produce a bilious condition, and can be eaten only sparingly by some people.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The vegetable foods that may, in a measure, replace meats should be found often on the tables of the people who must study economy. The housekeeper should never lose sight of the fact that there are certain kinds of food&#8212;the albu<span class='gtxt_body'>minous compounds&#8212;which are absolutely necessary for the growth and repair of the body, and that there must be a certain amount of these compounds in the food provided for each meal. There are few food substances that do not contain a little of each of the food principles, so that, without any thought or planning on our part, we get a certain amount of each in our daily food. The following tables may be helpful to the housekeeper in arranging the menus for the day:</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The heart-wood is that part of the tree which lies between the sap-wood and the pith. This part of the log is generally much closer grained, harder, and darker than the sap-wood. It contains only a small amount of soluble organic matter, and is therefore less liable to decay than the sap-wood. In many of the soft woods there is no perceptible<span class='gtxt_body'>
difference in the color of the heart- and sap-wood; this is the case with poplars, soft pine, spruce, etc.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Air and moisture combined are destructive to wood. When wood is kept dry and exposed to the air, it is not liable to rapid decay. Wood sunk deep in water or earth is less liable to decay than when exposed ^tionof&quot; to the air and frequent wettings. Any applica- air and tion that will exclude the air will tend to preserve g^^v^, wood. Paint, oil, and varnish are the most com- <span class="gstxt_sub">W00</span>d. mon preservatives. All woods that have an outside exposure should be painted or oiled, or treated with one of the many preservatives on the market.</p>

Locust, cedar, and chestnut, in the order in which they are named, are the best woods for putting in the ground.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Wood that has a resinous substance distributed throughout its structure resists decay when exposed to air and moisture. The resins are insoluble in water, and HeMMiM harden on exposure to air, thus making the wood woods impervious to moisture. It is for this reason that resist deyellow pine (the long-leafed pine commonly called Georgia pine) is so desirable for piazzas, kitchen and laundry floors, and all other situations where wood is exposed to air and moisture.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>closer grained and the smoother the wood is planed, the less liable it is to absorb moisture; hence the more durable.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Wood that has had the sap dissolved and soaked out of it, and is then dried with care in well-ventilated sheds, is more durable than the wood that has had the sap dried in it. In drying, wood shrinks in its breadth and depth, and little, if any, in the length. If these woods absorb moisture they expand in the direction in which they contracted. All woods warp more or less when exposed to atmospheric In selecting woods for floors, doors, windows, etc., care should be taken to choose those having the least tendency to warp. Some of the woods having this tendency are all the poplars and the short-leaved yellow pine.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The mode of sawing the boards has much to do with the wearing quality of the wood in floors. Among lumberdealers, boards are designated from the manner of cutting, as &quot;quartered,&quot; &quot;rift or comb grain,&quot; and &quot;slash&quot; or &quot;bastard.&quot; The quartered and the comb grain give a board that wears smoothly and does not sliver, a most desirable quality in a floor. The slash or bastard, in some woods, peels off in fine slivers, making an unsightly and poor-wearing floor. This same wood is beautiful and quite durable in interior finishes that are well protected and not subject to friction, as, for example, in panels of doors. In some woods, such as maples and other hard woods, the slash is so fine and close that it never grows rough, and it can be used in furniture, interior finish, and floors quite as well as quartered or comb-grained wood. On the other hand, in all the pines, spruce, poplars, some of the ash, etc., the annual layers separate with more or less ease. An explanation of the manner of growth and cutting will help to an understanding of why we have so many unsatisfactory floors, and the remedy for them.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>&quot;The boards for floors should be planed on both sides. The planing on the under side is to prevent the wood from absorbing moisture.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>&quot;To insure the floor against becoming uneven because of the boards expanding if there is moisture, each board should be about one sixteenth of an inch narrower on the under side than on the top; this allows of expansion and contraction.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>POLISHED FLOORS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Slowly but surely the polished floor is making its way into homes in all parts of the country. &quot;Oh,&quot; some say, &quot;it is only a fad which will have its day, and pass away like other fads.&quot; On the contrary, it is not a passing fad, but a sensible hygienic fashion which has come to stay, and which commends itself to all thinking people. The advantages of such a floor are its cleanliness and healthfulness, the ease with which a room with such a floor can be kept clean, and, after the first cost, the economy of it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>One has only to observe the difference in sweeping a carpeted floor and one that is uncarpeted to realize the greater cleanliness and healthfulness of the polished floor. When sweeping is being done in the carpeted room, <span class="gstxt_sup">T</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> &#176;J<span class="gstxt_sub">)</span>j<span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>&quot;&quot; the dust rises in clouds, more or less heavy, ac- polished cording to the condition of the carpet and the <i>^l^<span class="gstxt_sup">7</span> </i>method of using the broom. Naturally the dust sanitary, settles on the walls, doors, and windows, and is inhaled by the sweeper. To remove it requires time and care, and a second breathing of dust-laden air for the sweeper.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>On the other hand, the hair brush or dust-mop may be passed gently over the polished floor, taking up all the dust without raising or scattering it. The dust on walls, woodwork, or furniture is but slightly increased by this sweeping, and the person cleaning is not compelled to breathe diseasegerms with the dust. Certainly the floors of rooms continually in use, such as the dining-room, living-room, bedrooms, and bath-rooms, should be polished, or covered with a fine, closely woven matting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By polished floors is meant any floor finished smoothly,<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Although hard wood is the most desirable material in every way for a floor, one can manage with a pine floor that is fairly well finished. The tendency of pine boards to sliver, and their softness, make it impossible to have a beautiful floor, but one can get fair results and a reasonable amount of wear out of it if it is treated carefully, and if rugs are laid where the greatest wear comes. Crude petroleum can be used to cleanse floors that have Use of ^<span class="gstxt_sup">een</span> pai<span class="gstxt_sup">n</span>ted, varnished, or oiled.

If the floor is to be kept the color of the &quot;^floor.<span class="gstxt_sup">4118</span> wood, it must be waxed or varnished with a clear varnish. Oil darkens a wood. The more oil used, the darker the wood is made. Wood that is oiled darkens with age. The lightest oil used for cleaning and oiling woods is petroleum. When linseed-oil, sweet-oil, or paraffin-oil is employed for cleaning or polishing woods, it is diluted with turpentine to make it lighter. Any surface except a waxed surface may be polished with oil.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Many persons object to the wood floor on the score of danger and cold. When one remembers that the hard-wood floor is, as a rule, an extra layer of boards, perfectly joined, it will be seen that it is a better protection against wind and dust than is the carpet. Besides, one always has rugs on which the feet rest when one is sitting. As to danger, these floors need not be so highly polished that there is danger from them. An oiled floor is less slippery than one that is waxed. A floor polished with encaustic can be made less slippery than one polished with the pure wax. The amount and hardness of the rubbing makes the floor more or less beautiful, and also more or less slippery.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Small, smooth rugs should not be put at doors or on hall floors, where one is apt to walk quickly and without thinking. There is no danger when the rug is large and heavy. The coarse Japanese rug is excel- ^jfjjjfo, lent, because it does not slip easily on the pol- floors, ished surface. Otherwise, if one disposes of the rugs by couches, tables, etc., there is no danger. I should advise a strip of carpet on polished stairs. The sides can be kept as brilliantly polished as one may wish. In caring for a hard-wood floor, it must be remembered that <span class="gstxt_sub">of</span> water is one of the worst things that can be used. water on If at any time there should seem to be a necessity <span class="gstxt_sup">p</span><span class="gstxt_sub">fl</span>o^<span class="gstxt_sub">s</span><span class="gstxt_sup">ed</span> for cleaning with water, it must be only by means of a soft cloth wrung out of warm water. It must also be rubbed with another dry one. Then it should be oiled or polished at once. Any liquid spilled upon a waxed floor and allowed to dry of itself will produce a stain which can only be removed by hard rubbing and the encaustic. Even drops of clean cold water will spot a waxed floor unless they are wiped at once.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The daily care of the hard-wood floor is very simple. If the room is much used, it must be swept first with a soft hair brush, then wiped with a long-handled dust-mop of floorTM which comes for this purpose and is also known as a yacht-mop. When a room is not used much the dust-mop is all that is required. If there are spots on the floor, they should be rubbed with a piece of flannel or carpet. If this does not remove them, they may be cleaned with a little turpentine on a piece of cloth; this takes off the polish, and it will be necessary to rub the spot with a cloth moistened with encaustic or with oil, according to the finish, and then polish it.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Once a week all the spots should be wiped clean, and a cloth moistened with encaustic, or oil and turpentine, should Weekly ^<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">ruD</span>bed on any parts of the floor where the polcare of ish has worn off; then the floor should be rubbed <span class="gstxt_sup">ha</span>flo&quot;or&#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">0d</span> with a weighted brush.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>WAXED FLOORS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The floor to be waxed should be perfectly smooth and clean. The boards of a close-grained wood made perfectly<span class='gtxt_body'>
smooth can be waxed without any other preparation. An open-grained wood will require filling. If the wood is desired one or many shades darker than the original Preparing tone, some color can be put in with the filler. The the floor filling and staining, if any, are generally done by <i><span class="gstxt_sup">foiwaxm</span>B</i>the men who finish the floors.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR OILING FLOORS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The oiled floor is often unsatisfactory because the work has been done improperly. Sometimes the oil used was too heavy, and it may not have been rubbed into the wood thoroughly. Then, again, the floor and room may not have been perfectly clean, so that the floating dust lodged in the oiled surface and soon became black and unsightly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the boards are new, and one wants to saturate them with boiled linseed-oil, the oil should be made rather hot. Have the room and floor perfectly clean. Dip a <span class="gstxt_sub">Applica</span>. broad paint-brush in the oil and go over the floor, tion of</p>

Let this stand for an hour or more; then cover a weighted brush with a woolen cloth, and go over all the floor, rubbing with the grain of the wood. The polishing must be continued until the floor looks smooth and not oily.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Another way is to mix two thirds boiled linseed-oil with<span class='gtxt_body'>
one third turpentine. Wet a cloth in this mixture, and rub it into the boards, following this with a brisk rubbing with a woolen cloth in the hands or on a weighted brush.</span></p>

Have the surface to be oiled perfectly clean and free from floating dust. Rub the oil mixture well in, and let it stand an hour or more to dry. Finally, rub the surface briskly with a woolen cloth until it has taken a polish and there is no moist oil on the surface.</p>

The odor of petroleum is very disagreeable, but if there be a free sweep of air through the room it passes off in a short time.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Petroleum does not contain enough fat to give a fine, soft finish to boards; therefore the floor should be treated with boiled linseed-oil and turpentine about once in two or three months when a room is not subjected to hard usage. For a kitchen floor once a month is a fair average.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>APPLIANCES USED IN POLISHING FLOORS</p>
</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Upon the right selection and proper treatment of the appliances used in the care of floors will depend the success and ease with which the work is done. There will be required soft cloths (woolen, when possible), clean pieces of carpet, one long-handled and one short-handled hair brush, one dust-mop (sometimes known as a yacht-mop), one dustpan, one weighted brush, boiled linseed-oil, turpentine, wax, and a metallic or stone receptacle for cloths used in oiling and waxing.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The weighted brush, oil, turpentine, and wax are the only additional appliances necessary for the care of polished floors; all the other implements are such as are also required for ordinary floors.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The weighted brush may be bought at any first-class kitchen-furnishing store, and it costs about five _ dollars. It is indispensable in a house where floors weighted are waxed, and is most useful in polishing any jJJJJJr^Sf floor. It is a broad, flat brush made from the best Russian bristles. On this brush is fastened a loaded top.<span class='gtxt_body'>
A long handle, which can be bent to a certain angle, is fastened into this. When this brush is placed on the waxed surface it is pushed back and forth until the boards tak,e a high polish. At first it moves with difficulty, but after it has passed back and forth over the surface two or three times it slides over easily. On no consideration must this brush become oily. When any oiled surface is to be polished, the brush is covered with a thick woolen cloth or piece of carpet, which can be fastened on with safety-pins. It is important that this brush be kept perfectly clean, and for this reason it must always be kept covered when not in use.</span></p>

Sop it up and down in the water, then rinse thoroughly in clear, cold water. Wipe and turn it up to dry in a current of air. It takes some time to dry, so the washing should not be attempted just before polishing the floor. The drying must never be hurried by placing the brush near heat, as that would spoil it. With this care a weighted brush ought to be serviceable from ten to twenty years. When the bristles are worn out a new brush can be put on the loaded top. The dust-mop, which is a thick mop of soft cotton thread<span class='gtxt_body'>
fastened to a long handle, costs about seventy-five cents.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of washing-soda in four quarts of boiling water, and pour into a pail.

All the dirt and soda will have been washed out in this manner. Put two quarts of warm water and a tablespoonful of linseed-oil in a pail. Rinse the cloths in this, and put them out to dry. The soda will have removed all the dirt and wax, and also some of the natural oil of the wool. The oil is put in the last water to replace the oil washed from the wool and thus keep it soft.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The pieces of carpet used in polishing must tacies for receive the same treatment. All materials used polishing in oiling and polishing must be kept in covered ^doths! non-combustible receptacles, because these materials are liable to spontaneous combustion. Stone jars with covers, or tin pails or boxes, make safe receptacles for cloths saturated with oil or turpentine.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>HOW TO MAKE PADS FOR WOOD FINISHING</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Make smooth, hard little rolls of cotton batting about the size of a small walnut; cover these with bits of old linen, cotton, or cheese-cloth. Leave the ends long enough to get a firm hold. Fasten by winding a thread round the cloth where it is drawn over the ball of cotton.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The points to be especially careful of in making these pads are that the ball of cotton should be smooth and firm, and that the cloth must be drawn smoothly over it and tied securely.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In the course of time finely polished woods become dull and cloudy; the dampness in the atmosphere also has this effect on polished surfaces. The brilliancy and luster may be restored by thorough rubbing with the proper appliances. The methods here given may be used on the finest finishes, be they oil or varnish; but the treatment is not intended for waxed surfaces.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Varnished woodwork, when it becomes very much soiled, may be washed with soap and water, if the varnish is unbroken. But if the varnish is worn off, or if there is a scratch deep enough to cut through the varnish, water should not be used until the surface has been soaked in oil for some time. When the wood is unprotected by varnish or oil, the water penetrates it, and makes a dark stain, which grows darker with time and spoils the appearance of the</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The above methods are for oiled or varnished furniture. If the finish is wax, the cleaning must be done with turpentine and the surface polished with wax. (See Encaustic No. 1.)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To clean the woodwork of waxed furniture, wet a woolen cloth with turpentine, and go over the soiled surface, rubbing briskly. When all is cleaned, spread the <span class="gstxt_sub">Toc</span>i<span class="gstxt_sub">ean</span> softened prepared wax on a woolen cloth, and woodwork rub this on the surface to be polished. Let it stand an hour, if possible; then rub with a brush; follow this by another rubbing with a woolen cloth. If this rubbing is followed by a brisk rubbing with cork, the luster will be much finer; but in any case the friction must be thorough enough to remove all traces of the wax and leave a brilliant polished surface. While a thorough polishing of a surface finished in oil is always desirable, a moderate amount of friction will answer; but when wax is used, it is absolutely necessary that there is thorough rubbing with some woolen substance. For this reason, unless one has a strong man to do the work, it is better to use the oil and turpentine, oil and alcohol, or oil and vinegar.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The cork may be purchased at a paint-supply cork for shop or at a chemical-supply shop. It comes in polishing, sheets or large disks. Before using it, make the surface smooth with fine sandpaper.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Lubricating oils. Cleaning oils. Oils used as foods and medicines. Cotton-seed oil. Castor-oil. Cod-liver oil. Spontaneous combustion.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Oils are so continually in use in every department of the household that they are an important element in the domestic management. They enter into the composi<span class="gstxt_sup">K</span>ofTheir&#39;<span class="gstxt_sup">e</span> ^<span class="gstxt_sup">on</span> of pa<span class="gstxt_sup">in</span>t<span class="gstxt_sup">s</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span>d varnishes, into the substances action and used in the finishing and cleaning of woods, met<span class="gstxt_sup">tt</span>P?^<span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>&quot; als, machinery, etc., and into the making of many essential, of our foods and medicines. Ignorance of their source, action, and application often leads to their wrong use and renders them worthless.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>As space is limited, it will only be possible to make the briefest mention of the oils most commonly used in and about the household.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Oils may be divided into three classes&#8212;<i>animal, vegetable, </i>and <i>mineral; </i>and these, from their characteristics, are again classified <i>as fixed </i>and <i>volatile. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The term &quot; fixed &quot; may be defined as made fast, firm, stable, not wandering. If we spill a few drops of oil on a paper, Definition and then expose the stain to the action of air and &#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">f</span>vohitile<span class="gstxt_sup">d</span> ^S^t for a few days, we can determine whether oils. the oil is fixed or volatile. If it is a fixed oil the stain will be as apparent after this exposure as when it was<span class='gtxt_body'>
first made; sometimes it will even be darker. If, on the other hand, all traces of the stain have disappeared, the oil is volatile; that is, it is unstable, and passes off by evaporation. We can make this test more quickly by placing the stain near a heated surface.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='flow' style=''>
<a class='page'  id='PA289'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>All mineral oils are volatile; hence we can use them for cleaning and other purposes where it is desirable that all traces and odor of the oil should disappear quickly. The mineral oils are petroleum, which is found <span class="gstxt_sup">M</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">al</span> already formed in the earth in almost every quarter of the globe, and other oils obtained by the distillation of bituminous bodies, such as cannel-coal, coal-tar, etc. We are familiar with the products of these oils in the form of crude petroleum, kerosene, naphtha, gasolene, etc.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The vegetable oils fall naturally into two classes&#8212; the <i>fat oils </i>and the <i>essential oils. </i>Of these the fat oils are fixed, and the essential oils are volatile. The essential oils, of which there are many, are pro- Ej^j^ duced in nearly every part of the various plants oils, except in the cotyledon of the seed, where the fixed oil is found. These oils are obtained from the plant by pressure, by distillation, by solvents, and by maceration. The most familiar example we have of obtaining oil by pressure is the process by which the oil is extracted from the rinds of fruit. The thin yellow rind of lemons, oranges, or limes is finely divided and then subjected to great pressure. Or the method used in the kitchen is more common still: the rind is scraped off by the grater, or a piece of lump sugar is rubbed over the rind. In any case the object is to break the oil-ducts and press out the essential oil. Most of the essence or oil of commerce is obtained by distillation.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>By maceration is understood the process by which the essential oil of delicate flowers and plants is obtained. Melted fats have the power of absorbing essential oils from vegetable substances. The petals of flowers are placed in</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>melted fat and allowed to rest there until they have parted</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>with their perfume. They are then removed, and fresh</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>ones put in their place. This is continued until the fat has</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>absorbed the required amount of perfume. In the kitchen</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>this principle may be used to advantage in the cooking of</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>certain vegetables. (See &quot;Cause of Strong Odors, Flavors,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>and Colors in Vegetables.&quot;)</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The fixed vegetable oils are obtained from seeds and</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>fruits. These are sometimes crushed and pressed cold,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>sometimes heated and pressed, and sometimes</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Drying and boiled in water, to extract the oil. The oils pronon-drying</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>oils. cured in this way may be divided into two classes <i>&#8212;drying oils </i>and <i>non-drying oils. </i></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Nearly all fixed oils absorb oxygen freely when exposed to the air. The effect of the oxygen is to cause the oils either to harden or to turn rancid. The oils that harden are called drying oils, and those that turn rancid are known as nondrying oils. The drying oils that the housekeeper has most to do with are the three forms of linseed-oil&#8212;common linseed-oil, cold-drawn oil, and boiled oil.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The common linseed-oil is obtained from the crushed seeds heated nearly to the boiling-point and then pressed. This oil is brown in color.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Cold-drawn linseed-oil is obtained by pressing</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Cold- the crushed seeds without heat. This oil is of a drawn . linseed-oil. light color and is more expensive than the common oil.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In oiling floors and other surfaces where it is important that the oil should dry quickly, the boiled linseedoil should be used. Indeed, the boiled linseed-oil should always be used on the floors and inside finishes of the house.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Alcohol dissolves linseed-oil, as do turpentine and kerosene to some extent. When oiled surfaces, like floors, become dark and soiled because the boards were not properly polished after the oiling, they may be j*^^ cleaned with turpentine or kerosene, unless the Unseed-oil. stain is of long standing, in which case alcohol may be used. Hot alcohol has a much greater solvent power than the cold. If the alcohol is to be used hot, it should be put in a bottle, which may be placed in a dish of tepid water. Heat the water gradually to the boiling-point. Keep the bottle in the hot water while applying the alcohol to the floor.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Linseed-oil being a fixed oil, and containing a resinous substance, particles of dust are apt to attach themselves to the surface on which it has been used, unless there has been great care in polishing. By combining the linseed-oil with alcohol, turpentine, or even with kerosene, a volatile element is added, and the process of polishing and drying is hastened.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For woodwork that requires a thorough oiling nothing but a little turpentine should be added; and for an outside exposure, like doors, piazza floors, etc., only the pure oil should be used, and in this case the ordinary oil answers all purposes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Paraffin-oil is a product of petroleum, or of the distillation of bituminous bodies. It is the oil that passes over <i>after </i>kerosene, and is a much heavier oil than the latter. This oil must not be confounded with the <span class="gstxt_sub">oil</span> solid white paraffin, a great portion of which is obtained from petroleum and bituminous products. Nor must it be confused with the English paraffin, which is the kerosene manufactured from bituminous bodies.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Paraffin is a pale-yellow oil. It contains little, if any, resinous substance, and it is excellent for polishing furniture or woodwork when a very <i>fat </i>oil is not required. It<span class='gtxt_body'>
may be used in the pure state, or mixed in any proportion with alcohol, turpentine, or vinegar.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>LUBRICATING OILS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Some of the qualities essential in the lubricating oils in use in the household are: &quot;(1) Freedom from a tendency to Essential &amp;<span class="gstxt_sup">um</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">or</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">ox</span>idize; (2) sufficient body to keep the surquaiitiesin faces between which it interferes from coming in <span class="gstxt_sup">1Ub</span>oUs<span class="gstxt_sup">ting</span> <span class="gstxt_sup">contact</span>; (<span class="gstxt_sup">3</span>) <span class="gstxt_sup">the</span> greatest fluidity consistent with 2; (4) absence of acid and other properties injurious to materials in contact with it&quot; (James Cameron).</p>

For oil win lawn-mowers and such heavily working machines dissolve a good sewing-machine oil is all that is required. substances. Even when exercising the greatest care in purchasing a lubricating oil, one sometimes gets one that is adulterated with a resinous oil. In that case the article oiled &quot;gums up&quot; and will run hard. Kerosene-oil will dissolve this gummy substance. Pour it on the article freely (first, of course, protecting floors and other near-by objects), and set the machinery, door-hinges, locks, or whatever may have been &quot;gummed,&quot; in rapid motion. Then clean off with a soft, clean cloth, and oil with the machineoil. It must be remembered that kerosene merely cleans; it is not a lubricating oil.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>No drying oil, or intermediate oil, <i>i. e., </i>half-drying oil, such as castor-oil, cotton-seed oil, etc., should be used as a lubricating oil.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>CLEANING OILS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Among the cleaning oils, the most important are gasolene, naphtha or benzene, benzole, and oil or spirits of turpentine.<span class='gtxt_body'>
These oils are exceedingly volatile, and give off inflammable vapors. When using them for cleaning, the room Cleaning in which they are should be well ventilated, and &#176;j^^a&quot; care should be taken not to bring them near fire, inflamlamps, candles, or any other light. mable.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Turpentine dissolves grease, wax, and tar. It is useful in cleaning waxed surfaces, and is sometimes used in the laundry for whitening clothes. It is valuable for making preparations of either wax or oil, for polishing wood and tiles, and it is also valuable as a medicine. It is one of the articles that it is wise to have always in the house; it should be kept in a well-corked bottle.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>OILS USED AS FOODS AND MEDICINES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The oils used as foods and medicines belong to the nondrying or intermediate class of oils. The non-drying oils absorb oxygen, as do the drying oils; but the ef- <span class="gstxt_sub">Effect</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">rf</span> fect of the oxygen is to cause them to grow ran- oxygen on cid; therefore, in keeping them, they should be <span class="gstxt_sup">non</span><span class="gstxt_sub">0</span>^<span class="gstxt_sup">riDS</span> protected from the air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Olive-oil, also known as sweet-oil or salad-oil, is made from the unripe fruit of the olive-tree. There are several grades of this oil, the finest being the virgin oil. In making <span class="gstxt_sub">0</span>live-oil this oil the fruit is torn, not crushed, and very little, if any, pressure is used. This process gives an oil of the finest and most delicate flavor. By this means only a small portion of the oil is extracted from the fruit. The second grade of oil is made by pressing the cold pulp of the fruit from which the virgin oil has been extracted, in bags or baskets made from some inodorous material. The third grade is made from the pressed pulp, which is mixed with cold water and pressed again. This pulp is treated with water once more, heated, and pressed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Another method is to subject the pressed fruit to a gentle heat after the virgin oil has been extracted, and to press the oil out. Still another method is to mix the crushed fruit with boiling water and then press. Sometimes the crushed fruit is allowed to ferment before the pressing, or the fermented fruit is boiled in water and the fat skimmed off. Finally the different waters from which the oil has been skimmed are allowed to stand, and the particles of oil that collect on them are skimmed off. This last is the poorest of all the oils, and is known as the oil of the infernal regions. It is used for oiling stone and tiled floors, and in making soap.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Much of the olive-oil sold at the present day is adulterated<span class='gtxt_body'>
with other oils, such as cotton-seed oil, lard-oil, nut-oil, poppy-oil, etc. Pure olive-oil has a slightly greenish-yellow</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body gtxt_lineated'>Stains on fabrics. Stains on wood. <br/>    STAINS ON FABRICS <br/></p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Stains of all kinds are of constant occurrence in the household. There are many simple remedies for removing</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>most of them. The simplest methods should altry<span class="gstxt_sup">W</span>flrrt <span class="gstxt_sup">wavs</span> be tried first. Remember that the chemical the simple which removes the stain will generally attack the for nam<span class="gstxt_sup">8</span>&#39; f<span class="gstxt_sup">aDr</span>i<span class="gstxt_sup">c</span>, <span class="gstxt_sup">an</span>d therefore should be resorted to only ing stains, when harmless remedies have failed. Nearly all</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>stains are easily removed when first made; after they have dried in the fabric, or, worse still, if they have been washed with soap, the stain is fixed and is difficult to remove.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Water is one of the very best agents for removing stains when they are first made, and it has this advantage: it does not injure the material.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Chemicals are very valuable when used properly; but it must be remembered, when using them, that the moment Value of ha<span class="gstxt_sup">ve</span> ^<span class="gstxt_sup">one</span> their work in removing the stain</p>

If an alkali, such as caustic soda, caustic potash, or lime, is used, the neutralizer may be a few drops<span class='gtxt_body'>
of acetic acid in a pint of water; or, failing in that, any acid, like vinegar or lemon-juice, may be employed, in which case teaspoonfuls will be required to take the place of the drops of the acetic acid; that is to say, five or six teaspoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice will be required to replace one of acetic acid.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In cases where acids have been employed to remove stains, neutralize with a solution of ammonia&#8212;about a tablespoonful of household ammonia to a pint of water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If one knows the nature of the stain, the work of removing it may be undertaken more intelligently and with better success than if working in the dark. The agent <span class="gstxt_sub">0ne</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">muBt</span> that will generally remove grease-spots&#8212;warm know the</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Cold, tepid, or hot water may be used on most successstains, and although it will not always remove <span class="gstxt_sup">y</span>&#39; them, still it will rarely fix them. Blood stains, however, are fixed by hot water, and softened and partially removed by cold or tepid water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Sometimes the agent that of itself makes a stain is useful in loosening or changing the character of another stain, as, for example, the wetting of a black-ink stain with red ink, or when lard is rubbed on the black stain that sometimes gets on articles made on a sewing-machine.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When an article becomes stained, the first care is to learn the nature of the stain; then the remedies may be applied.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Ink Stains.&#8212;Nearly all ink stains may be removed if treated at once; but even then there is a great difference in the readiness with which the various preparations of ink yield to prompt and careful treatment. For example, a stain from some stylographic ink may be removed by thorough washing with soap and water, while in the case of others the stain must be soaked in milk or some other substance for a long time, even after it has had a thorough<span class='gtxt_body'>
washing in water. The stains from some makes of ink yield only to a chemical, and even the strongest chemicals are sometimes powerless.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Cold or tepid water never fixes a stain; neither does milk; therefore these are always safe to use in removing the greater part of the ink. If it is necessary to use other agents after this, the work will be more rapid, and there will be less danger to the fabric than if the chemical were required to remove all the ink.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When ink is spilled, if it is an article that may be put into a basin of water, do this immediately, rinsing the stain in repeated waters until no more ink can be reInkbyTM <span class="gstxt_sup">move</span>d in that way; then soak in hot or cold milk, soaking in sweet or sour. This treatment may remove the <span class="gstxt_sup">W</span>mUk&#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">r</span> stain at once, or it may require several days&#39; soaking in the milk. In some cases, however, there will remain a distinct dark stain, which may be removed by soaking a few minutes in Javelle water or in a weak solution of chloride of lime, or acids may be employed to remove the stain.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Should the ink be spilled on a garment, carpet, floor,</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Should there be no color to injure in the stained article, the surface may be sprinkled with common salt before each application of the lemon.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The foregoing method is for fresh stains. Any of the following methods may be employed for old stains.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Lemon-Juice and Salt&#8212;Spread common salt on the stain, and wet with lemon-juice; place in the sun. Repeat every day until the stain disappears, rinsing the spot in clean water before each new application of salt and lemon. When the stain is removed, wash the fabric, and rinse thoroughly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Oxalic Acid.&#8212;With a sponge or piece of soft cloth, rub the stain gently with a strong solution of oxalic acid. When the stain disappears, rinse thoroughly, and neutralize with weak ammonia water. Or wet the finger in water, dip it in powdered oxalic acid, and rub gently on the stained spot; continue this until the stain disappears. If heat can be applied, the stain will disappear more quickly. Wash and neutralize.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Oxalic Acid and Cream of Tartar.&#8212;Mix together one teaspoonful of powdered oxalic acid and one of cream of tartar. Spread a little of the powder on the stain, and moisten with lemon-juice or water; rub gently with the finger; repeat until the stain is removed. Do this with heat, if possible.

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If the stain is on a carpet, floor, or piece of furniture, first make the spot warm by placing a warm iron or any other warm substance on it; then fill a flat-bottomed earthen or china basin with boiling water; wet the stained spot with the mixture to be used, then place the hot basin over it. In about two minutes remove the basin, and rub the spot with fresh mixture; cover again with the hot dish. Follow this until the stain disappears.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It must be remembered that oxalic acid is a poison, and should be so marked, whether it is in the liquid or the powdered state.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With Red Ink.&#8212;Wet the ink stain with red ink, and wash in clear water, then in soap and water. This method will remove some ink stains, but not all.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With Muriatic Acid.&#8212;Wet the stain, and spread it over a bowl of boiling-hot water. Rub the spot gently with a glass stopper wet with the acid, then plunge the spot in the hot water. It may be necessary to repeat this several times. Rinse the article in ammonia water, and then in several clear waters.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With Javelle Water.&#8212;Cover the stain with Javelle water, and let it soak until the stain disappears. Sometimes this will be in a few minutes, and again it may take a long time. There are but few stains that resist this treatment. Rinse in ammonia water and in clear water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>With Turpentine.&#8212;Soak the stain in turpentine and then rub gently. This may be used on colored fabrics. The acids and other strong chemicals should not be used on colored articles.</p>

If the stain is on a fabric or surface that cannot be washed, cover with wet starch. When the starch dries, rub it off, and repeat the dose of wet starch; continue this until the stain disappears.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Green Stains, from grass or other vegetable substances, may be removed with alcohol or kerosene. Wash the stain in kerosene (it will turn yellow), then wash with soap and water, and the stain will disappear; or wash in alcohol.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Soot Stains.&#8212;These stains must always be treated with a dry solution if the stain is on a carpet or other fabric. Rub the spot with any of the following materials (continue removing the soiled material and add fresh until the stain has disappeared): starch, flour, corn-meal, fullers, earth, and salt.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the stain is on marble or wood, remove the greater part of it with dry materials, and then wash with soap and hot water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Eunning Colors.&#8212;When an article has been stained by coming in contact with a colored fabric that has been wet with water, as a rule the stain may be soaked out. As soon as possible after discovering the accident, put the article to soak in plenty of cold water; at the end of ten or twelve hours wash it out of this water, and dry in the sun.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Iodine Stains.&#8212;Wash the stain with alcohol, then rinse in</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>clear water, if the material may be washed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Vaseline Stains.&#8212;The stains from vaseline are most diffi<span class='gtxt_body'>cult to remove. Ether seems to be the only liquid that will dissolve vaseline. Sponge the stain with it. This is too expensive an agent to use in large quantities.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Iron Rust may be removed by muriatic acid, oxalic acid, or lemon and salt. Have a bowl of boiling water. Spread the stained place over this; touch with the muriatic or oxalic acid, and when the stain changes to a bright yellow dip it in the water. Rinse the fabric in ammonia water and then in clear water. The salt and lemon-juice may be applied in this manner or on a hot plate, or the wet stain may be put in the sun. Being a weaker agent than the muriatic or oxalic acid, the lemon and salt take a longer time to remove the rust. To remove rust from iron or steel, wet the stain with sweet-oil, then cover with powdered quicklime. In a day or two rub off the mixture. If all the rust has not disappeared, repeat the application of oil and lime, then clean with oil and rottenstone, if the articles happen to be of steel; if common utensils, wash in strong soda-water, rinse with soap-suds, and wipe very dry.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Fruit Stains.&#8212;Spread the stained article over a large bowl, and pour <i>boiling </i>water through it until the stain disappears; or soak the stain for a short time in Javelle water. Another method is to soak the article in a weak solution of oxalic acid. The last two methods are to be employed only when the boiling water has failed, which it rarely does if used at once, except in the case of peaches, which make a stain very difficult to remove. Fruit stains may be removed with the fumes of sulphur. Wet the stain. Make a small funnel of stiff paper, and cut a piece from the small end; then place a bit of sulphur in a saucer, and set it on fire, covering it with the funnel. Hold the wet stain over the small opening, and when clean rinse thoroughly. The work must be done by an open window, and the operator must be careful not to inhale the fumes. When you have finished, extinguish the burning sulphur by covering it with a piece of<span class='gtxt_body'>
wet paper. A small stain may be removed by burning a sulphur match under the wet spot.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Paint and Varnish.&#8212;Alcohol and turpentine dissolve these two stains. Use turpentine on coarse fabrics, and alcohol on delicate ones. If there is a suggestion of a stain after the paint or varnish is removed, sponge the spot with chloroform or ether.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Grease-Spots.&#8212;When an article is washable, grease-spots may be removed with soap and water. Grease-spots may generally be removed by the application of a substance that has an affinity for grease. The simplest of all methods for removing grease is by absorption. Powdered French chalk or fullers, earth, mixed to a paste with water or turpentine, and spread on the grease-spot, will absorb it. This should be allowed to stand for several days, and the application then brushed off. Sometimes a second application of the paste may be necessary. For dark materials ox-gall is sometimes used with the turpentine and fullers, earth. If the ox-gall is decolorized, it may be used on light materials.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Blotting-paper may be put under and over the grease-spots; a warm iron should be placed on the top sheet of paper; change the paper until all the grease has been absorbed. The spot may then be lightly sponged with chloroform or ether.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Candle-grease should always be scraped from the surface of&#39;the article before an absorbent or other agent is used. When the fabric is very delicate, as, for example, light<span class='gtxt_body'>
silks or cloth, try dry French chalk. Spread it on the stain,</span></p>

Only the most volatile agents should be used on delicate colors; chloroform, ether, benzene, naphtha, and alcohol are, in the order given, the most volatile. Alcohol is more liable to affect the color than are the other agents.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It must be remembered that these liquids dissolve the grease, and that the operator must remove it by sponging the spot gently. Well-washed cheese-cloth is one of the best fabrics to rub with, as it does not leave lint, and is so cheap that one may use a clean piece with every application.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When cleaning with any of the dissolving agents it is important that the diluted grease does not spread over a larger surface than the original spot.

Work in this manner, changing the cleaning-cloth frequently, until the spot has disappeared. Rub gently with a dry cloth until the spot is perfectly dry. If any of the less volatile agents have been used, and there is a slight ring around the cleaned spot, sponge gently with chloroform.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Acid Stains.&#8212;When any common acid, such as lemon-juice, vinegar, muriatic acid, etc., is spilled on a colored fabric, it often changes the color. If the spot is lightly sponged with a dilute solution of ammonia,&#8212;one tablespoonful of household ammonia to four of cold water,&#8212;the color will be restored. The work must be done carefully, only touching the changed spot with the ammonia preparation.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Mildew.&#8212;The removal of this kind of stain is more or less difficult, depending upon the thoroughness with which the fabric has been affected by the mildew. Light and recent stains may often be removed by wetting them, rub<span class="gstxt_sup">1</span> bing on soap, and then covering the spots with wet starch.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Chloride of lime and Javelle water are both effective agents for the removal of mildew. In light cases the stain may disappear in less than half an hour, but where the stain is of long standing it may take twelve or more hours.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Wood, finished and unfinished, is easily stained by various substances.

A hot solution of potash may be poured on the grease-stained board, or, if one has wood-ashes, a quart of ashes and a quart of water may be simmered together for an hour, and then poured on the spot.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Carpet.&#8212;The durability and appearance of carpets, as well as the comfort of those walking on them, depend largely upon the manner in which the carpet is laid. Seldom can an amateur do this work as well as a trained workman, and<span class='gtxt_body'>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>A carpet of any kind that does not lie perfectly fiat gets twice as much wear as one that fits snugly to the u<span class="gstxt_sub">eoess</span>i<span class="gstxt_sub">ty</span> floor. A loose carpet moves about under the feet; of smoothly and a stiff material, like oil-cloth, linoleum, or laid oarmatting, cracks in the slight folds that are made.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The surface on which the carpet is laid has much to do with its durability. If the floor is rough and uneven, the carpet will not wear as long as if laid over a smooth surface.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Woolen carpets should always have a lining under them; the smoother and more even the lining, the better. There are many varieties of manufactured linings that are excellent for this purpose. If one cannot ^TMet&#187;. afford the prepared linings, thick layers of newspapers will answer. The regularly made pads should be used on the stairs.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The floor on which the carpet is to be laid must be measured accurately. If the carpet has a pattern, it should be studied carefully so that the breadths may be Matching joined with the figures matching. Allow for figures turning in at the ends. In sewing the carpet be <span class="gstxt_sup">carefull</span>ycareful to get it firm and strong, and see that it does not full in the seam.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Lay the lining, and fasten it in place with the smallest kind of a tack. Spread the carpet in position. Begin at one end, driving a few large tacks half-way into place, so that they may be easily drawn out. <span class="gstxt_sup">M</span>&#176;yfng&#176;<span class="gstxt_sup">f</span> This is to hold the carpet until it is tacked carpet, around the fireplace, in case there is one. Now with&#39; large tacks get the carpet laid smoothly around the mantel, then tack it regularly. Work back from the mantel to the end where the carpet is held in place with the large<span class='gtxt_body'>
tacks. Readjust the end, and tack it firmly, drawing the carpet very tight as you tack it.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Begin at the other side of the mantel, and tack that side. The carpet being tacked at one end and one side, it must now be stretched, pulling it from the tacked sides and ends. Put in large tacks, which may be drawn out again, to hold it in position.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Begin tacking at the opposite end of the room, using the stretcher continually; then finish by tacking the sides, still using the stretcher. Two people can lay a carpet better than one, because one can tack while the other holds the carpet firmly in place.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The most careful measurements must be taken, first for the lengths of the carpet, and next for the places carefully. th<span class="gstxt_sup">a</span>t must be cut&#8212;for example, to fit round a mantel, doorway, or register. If there is a register, the space to be left open should be Manner of measured and marked with chalk.

<p class='gtxt_body'>turned under. When a half-breadth must be used, the side that is cut should be bound and placed next to the wall. One breadth of matting should never lap over another.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When of the best quality, Canton mattings wear as well as a Brussels carpet. The breadths are never sewed together; they may be laid so smoothly as to seem almost a part of the floor. The cheaper grades, being woven loosely, do not rest so firmly on the floor, and are easily broken. They are expensive at any price.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Japanese mattings are very soft, pliable, and beautiful. The best are woven on a cotton or linen warp. They are sometimes sewed together like a woolen carpet, and are also tacked down edge to edge, as in the batting*, case of the Canton mattings. When sewed they do not lie as smoothly as when each breadth is tacked separately. Whether the mattings are sewed or tacked, pains should be taken to have them fit the floor as closely as possible. In laying matting, use the <span class="gstxt_sub">x</span>.JTM5 double tacks when two edges come together, and mattings, the single ones for the outside edges. When binding is used on a cut edge, match the shade of the matting as nearly as possible. Old holland shades make an excellent binding for matting.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Pretty mats can be made of the Japanese matting! Cut the mats the size desired, draw out strands at both ends sufficient to make a fringe, and over- <span class="gstxt_sub">ma</span>tting. cast the edges.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>It is a good plan to purchase enough of the matting to cut up for these mats, which may be placed where there is the most wear. They are so fine and thin that they seem almost a part of the floor-covering.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Oil-Cloth and Linoleum.&#8212;These coverings always stretch after they have been on the floor awhile. When measuring them, an allowance of half an inch should be made on all sides for stretching. After they have been in place a few<span class='gtxt_body'>
weeks, it may be found necessary to trim the edges an inch or more. If the carpet begins to bulge up anywhere, immediately examine the edges, and you will find that they are pressing against the walls. The trimming of the edges should be done at once; for if the covering lies too full, even for a short time, it will begin to crack, and its durability will be greatly diminished.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>The workmen who lay the floor generally finish it ready for the polisher. This is the case with all fine floors, but every one cannot afford perfectly made and finished floors. Many people would be glad to dispense with carpets, if they knew how to finish the ordinary floor so that it would look well and could be cared for with ease.

</div>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Prepared fillers may be bought at any paint-supply shop,</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>or they may be prepared at <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span>The object in using</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>them is to fill in the minutest interstices in the</p>

If the wood is <span class="gstxt_sup">T</span>^f<span class="gstxt_sub">ti</span><span class="gstxt_sup">c</span><span class="gstxt_sub">0</span>&#176;TM^<span class="gstxt_sub">f</span>&#176;&quot; dark, or the floor is to be colored, enough color- fiUers. ing-matter is added to the mixture to match the color of the boards or the color one wishes them to have. Sometimes, when it is desired to keep the boards very light, oil is omitted; but the boards do not finish so well as when oil is employed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For Light Wood.&#8212;Use one pint of boiled linseed-oil, one and a half quarts of turpentine, one pint of fine <i>^ </i>whiting or corn-starch (or half whiting or corn- making starch and half flake-white may be used). If the the differwood has color, add enough color to make the <span class="gstxt_sup">e</span>&quot;oiors?<span class="gstxt_sup">d</span> starch or whiting the same shade as the wood. For oak use a little raw umber, not quite a teaspoonful if the oak is white, more if it is dark.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>For Dark Wood.&#8212;Use one quart of boiled linseed-oil, one quart of turpentine, one pint of whiting or corn-starch. For mahogany add one tablespoonful of burnt sienna, one fourth of a teaspoonful of yellow ocher, half a teaspoonful of Bismarck brown.</p>

These ingredients must be mixed very thoroughly, and a little be rubbed on a board to test the color; for the coloringmatter varies in strength, and it is impossible to give the exact proportions.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Some of the close-grained woods&#39; in common use are bird,s-eye maple, cherry, and sycamore; these, of course, do not require a filler.

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If there are large cracks in the floor, fill them with putty before filling and staining. If there is a great deal of this filling of cracks to be done, the putty may be made by mixing linseed-oil and sifted whiting together.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Strong liquid ammonia or a strong solution of potash or washing-soda will dissolve paint or varnish. If, at the same time, it is desired that the boards be white, quicklime is used in the wash.

Care must be exercised, when applying these caustic preparations, not to get a drop on walls, base-boards, doors, etc. Strong household ammonia should be employed. It may be poured from the bottle on paint or varnish. All the windows should be opened. In about half an hour after the caustic has been applied, the paint or varnish will be soft, and it may be scraped off. Wet the spot to be removed with hot water, and scrape gently; continue this until the whole floor has been gone over. From time to time take up the <span class="gstxt_sub">Self</span>substance scraped from the floor. A smooth hoe wringing may be used for the scraping. When all is done, <span class="gstxt_sup">m</span>&#176;P wash the floor in several clean waters, and wipe dry. A self-wringing mop must be employed in washing the floor, as the caustic substance is injurious to the hands.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The soda and potash are used in the same manner. If soda is used, it should be dissolved in boiling water in the proportion of six quarts of water to a pound of soda. To prepare potash, put a pound of the crys- ^taJE* tals in a wooden pail, and pour on them six quarts of cold water; stir until dissolved, and then apply. The chemical action that takes place during the union of the water and the potash raises the temperature so that the mixture becomes hot. If lime and soda are to be mixed, put the soda in a pail with about a pound of quicklime, and on this pour the cold water. soda. The lime will slack immediately, and the soda will dissolve in the hot mixture. A combination of lime and potash is made in the same manner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To remove black or dark stains from the boards, pour a strong solution of oxalic acid on them, and they <span class="gstxt_sub">Using</span> <span class="gstxt_sub">ox</span>. will disappear after a short time.

<p class='gtxt_body'>Rub the boards with a piece of clean carpet, and wax, oil, or varnish, as you may prefer. If a dark color is desired, double the quantity of potassium permanganate. When a very strong solution has been used the color is a purplish brown.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>To clean plaster casts, cover them with fine dry whiting and fullers, earth. Wrap them in a cloth, and let them stand a few days; then gently brush off the cleaning-material. This will not always give a spotless cast, but it is the safest method. If a wet substance is applied to them there is danger of removing the thin coating, often changing the whole expression of a beautiful cast. The better way is to have some sort of finish put on at the mower,s, or one can do this at <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span></p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>TO WAX AND STAIN CASTS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Put a piece of common yellow wax, about the size of a large English walnut, in a cup or bowl. Place the cup in a pan with a little hot water, and put over a moderate heat until the wax is melted; then take the pan from the fire, and beat one gill of turpentine into the melted wax. With a soft brush apply the mixture lightly to the cast. When dry, rub down with a clean cloth until a good polish is obtained. Apply the wax again, dry, and polish. Continue this until the desired shade is obtained. If shadows and a<span class='gtxt_body'>
dark background are desired, add to the preparation left the tiniest bit of raw umber, emerald-green, or blue. Brush the places to be darkened with this and rub as before.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>HOW TO PUT NEW LININGS IN BOOTS AND SHOES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The kid or other linings in boots and shoes often become soiled or broken before the boots are half worn, and should be replaced by fresh ones. If the new linings are not properly fitted and pasted, they become a source of great discomfort. First cut an exact pattern of the sole of the boot. To do this, place the boot on a sheet of paper, and draw the outlines of the sole; then cut the pattern, which keep for future use. If kid is used, purchase, at a leather-store, one kid skin finished in white. Spread the skin on a board, finished side up, and lay the pattern on it, and with a pencil draw the outline. When you have drawn half the number of linings required, turn the pattern over and draw the other half; this will give you rights and lefts. Be careful, in outlining the soles, to place the pattern so as to give as little waste material as possible. Cut the leather with a sharppointed knife, following the pencil lines. One skin will make enough linings to last one person for years.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Make a paste with half a teaspoonful of flour mixed smooth with a tablespoonful of cold water. Pour on this enough boiling water to make a thin paste (about three tablespoonfuls). Tear the old linings out of the boot, then wipe thoroughly to be sure there are no particles of dust or lint adhering to the boot. Cover the wrong side of the lining with a thin layer of paste. Nearly double the lining, paste side in, and slip into the boot, unfolding it as it passes in place. See that it fits smoothly everywhere. Pass the hand gently over it, pressing lightly until the surface is perfectly smooth. Then go all over the surface with a piece of soft cloth, using a good deal of pressure. The boots should stand at least twelve hours to dry. If these directions are followed to the letter, the lining will fit and adhere perfectly.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>TO CLEAN COMBS AND BRUSHES</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Put enough water in a wash-bowl to reach the backs of the brushes, but not to flow over them. To each quart of water add one tablespoonful of borax. Free the brushes from dust, and place them, bristles down, in the water. Let them soak about ten minutes, then sop them up and down in the water until the bristles look clean. Rinse in plenty of clean cold water, and dry in a current of air.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Ammonia may be substituted for the borax; but as it softens the finish on the wooden backs of the brushes, it must be used with care.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Silver brushes may be immersed in the ammonia or borax water.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Heat and moisture dissolve the glue used to fasten the bristles to the back; therefore brushes of any kind should not be soaked for too long a time, and never in hot water. Never dry them in great heat.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Wash the combs in borax or ammonia water, rinse in cold water, and wipe dry. Combs should not be soaked or left wet.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Wet the soiled place with turpentine, and let it rest for ten or more minutes, then wet again. Scrape off the loosened dirt. Wet once more with the turpentine, and again scrape off the loose dirt. Continue this until all the dirt has been removed. In all the work let the scraping be very gentle, that the fabric may not be injured. Then sponge with a clean cloth and turpentine, and wipe until dry. The final sponging may be with alcohol or chloroform. These two substances evaporate quickly and leave a fresher-looking surface than when the cleaning is finished with turpentine.<span class='gtxt_body'>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Oil-bottles or other receptacles must be placed on several folds of paper or cloth, or on a plate or tray. Bottles in which there are acids, alcohol, or other cleaning substances, when in use, must always have paper placed under them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Soaps must always rest in a dish of some kind.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Cleaning-cloths must not be dropped carelessly anywhere; they should, if wet, be placed on paper.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When using any caustic substance, like lye, washing-soda, ammonia, the greatest care must be exercised that not a drop is spilled on paint or varnish; and if such an accident should occur, immediately use plenty of water on the spot, or pour on oil.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If alcohol is spilled on varnish, wash with water immediately, or pour on oil. Be careful not to spill an acid on marble; but should this happen, pour on water, and wash off quickly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In dusting or moving pictures, care should be used not to rub or handle roughly gilt frames. Oil-paintings must be dusted in the lightest and most careful manner, and should always be carefully covered before sweeping.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In European countries, where polished floors are the rule, steel shavings are used to clean off the floors when they become very much stained. In this country steel shavings or wool is used in rubbing down woodwork in interior finishes, but not much on floors. However, when properly used, this substance is a great aid in removing unsightly stains, or in making rough spots smooth. The American article is known as steel wool, and the imported article as steel shavings. The very coarse should be used on coarse floors, and the finer grade on fine floors. It may generally be found at painters, supply-shops.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-align:center;'>INSECTS AND VERMIN</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The housekeeper must always be on guard against the many enemies of foods, fabrics, materials, and personal comfort, which find entrance into the house in the form of insects and larger vermin. No place is exempt from these pests, but if one lives in a detached house it is a comparatively easy matter to keep it free from them. The dwellers in apartment and block houses are liable to invasion from the neighboring apartments. Water- and steam-pipes add to the ease with which water-bugs, cockroaches, etc., find their way through all parts of a building. Unscreened doors and windows admit flies, mosquitos, moths, etc. Rats and mice find their way into cellars and walls in the most unaccountable manner.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Absolute cleanliness and eternal vigilance are the price of freedom from these troublesome visitors. There are methods of exterminating all these plagues; but, when pos<span class='gtxt_body'>sible, the preventives should be employed. If, however, the housekeeper finds that any kind of vermin has found lodgment in her premises, she should use immediate and vigorous measures to exterminate them, using the cleanest, surest, and safest remedies that she is acquainted with. There are some manufactured articles on the market that will clean a house thoroughly of all insects, if used faithfully. The housekeeper may also employ successfully many substances with which she is familiar.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Naphtha, properly used, is one of the cleanest, easiest, and most effective remedies; but it must be used with intelligence and care. None but responsible, careful people should ever be allowed to employ this agent. The danger is from an inflammable gas which it gives off. If the work is done in a room where the windows are wide open, and there is neither light nor fire, there is not the slightest danger.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In attempting to exterminate any sort of insects by the use of naphtha, it must be remembered that the infested places must be saturated with the naphtha, and also that this only kills the living animal, not the eggs. After the first application of naphtha, wait three or four days, and saturate the places a second time; this will kill any life that may have developed from the eggs. When naphtha has been used in this manner, the windows of the room should be left open for several hours.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Water-bugs.&#8212;Pour a weak solution of turpentine into the pipes once a week for a few weeks, and the bugs will cease to make their visits. Use half a pint of turpentine to three pints of water. The turpentine will drive the bugs from their hiding-place, and they should be killed when they are seen. The remedies that will exterminate cockroaches will, as a rule, exterminate water-bugs also. The preparations that one buys for cockroaches are generally effective for water-bugs and ants.</p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Cockroaches.&#8212;One of the methods of drawing cockroaches into the house is to leave kitchen garbage standing about for hours. The greatest care should be exercised to destroy or remove all garbage as soon as the dishes are washedKeep all food covered; keep all corners and crevices clean and dry. There are several methods of exterminating the roaches.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>1. Blow insect-powder into all the cracks from which the pests come. In a few hours brush up the dead insects and powder, and burn them. Fill all cracks and holes with a second dose of powder. After a few hours brush up and burn powder and roaches. Then spread powdered borax about the cracks and holes.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Make a strong solution of carbolic acid, &#8212;two tablespoonfuls of the acid to a pint of water,&#8212;and force this solution into all the cracks and openings. The odor of the carbolic lasts for several days; one may, however, be comforted with the knowledge that nothing can be cleaner or more effective. It may require several applications of the solution.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>3. Dissolve one pound of alum in three pints of hot water, and force the hot solution into the cracks and openings. Afterward spread borax about the places where the roaches have been in the habit of appearing.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>Ants.&#8212;To exterminate ants, use the hot solution of alum or the carbolic solution as for cockroaches. Or pour oil of pennyroyal on a large piece of cotton-batting; tear this into small bits, and spread them about the places where the ants appear. The odor is very strong and lasting. With the removal of the cotton it soon disappears.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When the fresh pennyroyal can be procured, spread the leaves about the infested places.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Bedbugs.&#8212;l. The quickest, cleanest, and surest method of exterminating this pest is by the use of naphtha. Open all the windows in the room. Shake and examine all the<span class='gtxt_body'>
bedding. Hang out sheets, blankets, etc. Saturate the mattresses and pillows with naphtha, and put them out of doors, if possible. Brush the walls of the room, not leaving a particle of dust in crack, groove, or corner. Sweep the floor or carpet, if there is one. Take the bedstead apart, and lay the parts on the floor, the grooved sides up. Saturate all the joints and grooves with naphtha. Wet the carpet with the naphtha. If there are any cracks or breaks in walls or floor, fill them with naphtha. Then leave the room, locking the door, that no one may enter until all the gas has passed off. A few hours will answer, but where naphtha is used in large quantities, it is safer to keep the windows open and the door shut the greater part of the day.</span></p>

<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This application of naphtha will kill all the living insects that it comes in contact with, but not the eggs. In three or four days repeat the operation, and there will be no more trouble, unless the insects are in the wall, where the naphtha cannot reach them.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'><i>Caution: </i>Remember that there is great danger if fire or light is allowed in the room while the work is being done, or for hours after, while the inflammable gas is in the room. On the other hand, there is not a particle of danger if these directions are carefully followed. The advantage of the naphtha over all other remedies is that it is not injurious to any finish, fabric, or color. It leaves everything cleaner than at the beginning of the process. The work is quickly and easily done, and the odor passes off quickly.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>2. Clean the room as for the naphtha process. If there is a carpet, remove the tacks, then blow insect-powder all over it. Fold it from both sides toward the middle, and powder the parts that are folded over. Fold both ends toward the middle, and powder again. Roll the carpet up, powdering the under part as it comes to the top. By following these directions, every part of the carpet will be covered with the</p>

<a class='page'  id='PA345'></a>
<div class='gtxt_body'>
<p class='gtxt_body'>powder. Let the carpet lie rolled up in this manner for a day; then have it beaten and brushed.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Spray the mattress and pillows with the powder. Take the bedstead apart as for the naphtha process; wash it with a strong solution of carbolic acid, pouring the solution into the grooves and joints. Wash the base-boards and floor with the carbolic solution, spraying cracks and joints with it. Let the windows stand open all day. The odor of the carbolic will last for some time, but it is clean.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If there is a strong objection to the odor of carbolic, the insect-powder may be used instead. It may require two applications of either powder or carbolic. Old powder is not effective.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Examine the picture-moldings; they are generally made of the soft white woods in which these insects thrive.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Moths and Buffalo-bugs.&#8212;The naphtha treatment as for bedbugs will exterminate moths and buffalo-bugs. It must be remembered that all the eggs must be removed by brushing and shaking before the naphtha is applied; or, if not, treat the articles to a second dose of naphtha after three or four days.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Frequent thorough brushings, beatings, and airings will keep furnishings and garments free from these destructive insects.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If closets are washed in the spring and fall with a weak solution of carbolic acid, one may be reasonably sure that they will be free from insects.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Kill every moth-miller found flying in the house. Should you find the minutest colony of moths or buffalo-bugs in a piece of furniture or fabric, do not cast them to the four winds to prey upon your neighbors. Take the article into the laundry or a vacant room, and saturate it with naphtha; then put it out of doors, if you please; the moths will be beyond doing any further harm.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Flies and Mosquitos.&#8212;Of course, if good screens are on doors and windows there will be little trouble with either flies or mosquitos.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Open the windows. Put some insect-powder on an old plate; set fire to it, and place on an inverted tin pan in the middle of the room. Close the door. The smoke will drive the flies and mosquitos out of the room.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Eats and Mice. &#8212;If these vermin get into the house, the safest method of removing them is by the trap. Have all the holes filled in this manner: sprinkle chloride of lime in the hole, then fill in with broken glass, and finally seal with mortar or plaster of Paris. Bait the traps with meat; it is much more effective than cheese. If there must be delay in filling the holes, give them a generous dose of the chloride of lime.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>THERMOMETERS IN THE KITCHEN</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>If it were possible to use the thermometer freely in all culinary operations, the science of cookery would be very much simplified; but there are many obstacles in the way. The ordinary thermometer is very fragile, and must be used with the greatest care, and in the various dishes which are being prepared at the same time it would be impossible to use the instrument freely. The glass is liable to break when exposed to extremes of temperature. Many attempts have been made to produce a satisfactory oven-thermometer, but, so far as I know, the only successful one is based on the principle of the expansion and contraction of metals. This thermometer has an indicator like the face and hands of a clock, and is fitted into an opening in the oven door. While this thermometer does not indicate the temperature to a nicety, like mercury, it is accurate enough for all practical purposes. The trouble with a mercury thermometer is that when exposed continuously to a high temperature the mercury does not fall back easily, and sometimes refuses to do<span class='gtxt_body'>
so at any temperature. A thermometer that is used in cooking should be incased in copper. They may be purchased or ordered at any chemical supply-store.</span></p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In using a thermometer great care is necessary to protect the bulb from cracking or breaking. Always heat and cool it gradually. A thermometer, when plunged into a hot liquid, or when taken from a hot bath and exposed to cold air, is liable to break. The bulb must never rest on the bottom of a stew-pan. Be careful not to hit or jar it. Immediately after using, it should be wiped dry and carefully put away.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>THE MELTING-POINT OF SOME METALS AND ALLOYS</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Many household utensils are often exposed to too high a temperature, because of ignorance of the melting-point of the metal or alloy from which they are made. With the exception of iron and steel, but few pure metals are used in the manufacture of household articles, the greater number of metal articles being made with alloys.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>Many alloys melt at a much lower temperature than any one of the metals which enter into their combination. The following tables of the melting-point of a few of the metals and alloys will illustrate this fact.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>Britannia is made from tin, copper, and antimony in varying proportions, depending upon the quality of the product. If we were to estimate the melting-point of this alloy by that of the metals that enter into its composition, we should place it high; but we all know by experience that the melting-point is very low, so we are careful not to expose utensils made from this metal to a temperature much above the boiling-point of water (212&#176;).</p>
<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>In using utensils made from alloys of all kinds, the liability to melt at a low temperature must always be kept in mind, that the article may not be softened and gotten out of shape, or, worse still, injured beyond repair.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body'>When a bottle of olive-oil standing in a temperature of 75&#176; or 76&#176; looks a little thick or is necked with undissolved particles, it is an indication that it has been adulterated with an oil that melts at a higher temperature.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When butter holds its shape at a temperature above 95&#176;, it is an indication that it has been adulterated with some fat, like suet, that melts at a temperature above 95&#176;.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>When dry sugar is exposed to a temperature of 320&#176; it begins to melt; when the temperature reaches 400&#176; the sugar passes to the caramel stage, and from that to the dark, bitter substance known as burnt sugar.</p>

<p class='gtxt_body' style='text-indent:1em;'>BACTERIOLOGY</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>This wonderful science has developed so rapidly that it is almost impossible to realize that comparatively little was known about it twenty years ago. Through this science have been found means of preventing and arresting disease and decay in animal and vegetable life, and a knowledge of it is very important to the housekeeper, that she may protect her family and belongings against the ravages of the destructive bacteria. So many wild and absurd statements have been made by those who have only a superficial knowledge of the subject that the result has been to frighten some people and disgust others. There is no cause for either, and certainly it is criminal not to inform one&#39;s self on a subject that has such a power over our lives.</p>
<p class='gtxt_body'>The amount of knowledge on the subject necessary for the housekeeper is not difficult to acquire. There are several books written upon it that come within the comprehension of the most unscientific mind. &quot;The Story of Bacteria,&quot; by T. Mitchell Prudden, and &quot;The Story of Germ Life,&quot; by Professor H. W. Conn, are small books written in such a simple, clear style that they are within the understanding of a child, and no housekeeper should fail to include them in her library. The information they contain is presented in such an attractive form that it should mean, in the future, better conditions for the health and happiness of the <span class="gstxt_hlt">home. </span>&quot;The Principles of Bacteriology,&quot; by A. C. Abbott, is also a useful book for those desiring to study more of the subject. A book which is intended for the farm and dairy, &quot;The Principles of Modern Dairy Practice,&quot; by Gosta Grotenfelt, translated by F. W. Woll, is full of information for the housekeeper. It is very clearly and simply written, and is a most interesting book.</p>
