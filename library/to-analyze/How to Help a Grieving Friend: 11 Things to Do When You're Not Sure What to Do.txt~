I've been a therapist for more than 10 years. I worked in social services for
the decade before that. I knew grief. I knew how to handle it in myself, and
how to attend to it in others. When my partner drowned on a sunny day in 2009,
I learned there was a lot more to grief than I'd known.

Many people truly want to help a friend or family member who is experiencing a
severe loss. Words often fail us at times like these, leaving us stammering for
the right thing to say. Some people are so afraid to say or do the wrong thing,
they choose to do nothing at all. Doing nothing at all is certainly an option,
but it's not often a good one.

While there is no one perfect way to respond or to support someone you care
about, here are some good ground rules.

#1 Grief belongs to the griever.
You have a supporting role, not the central role, in your friend's grief. This
may seem like a strange thing to say. So many of the suggestions, advice and
"help" given to the griever tells them they should be doing this differently,
or feeling differently than they do. Grief is a very personal experience, and
belongs entirely to the person experiencing it. You may believe you would do
things differently if it had happened to you. We hope you do not get the chance
to find out. This grief belongs to your friend: follow his or her lead.

#2 Stay present and state the truth.
It's tempting to make statements about the past or the future when your
friend's present life holds so much pain. You cannot know what the future will
be, for yourself or your friend -- it may or may not be better "later." That
your friend's life was good in the past is not a fair trade for the pain of
now. Stay present with your friend, even when the present is full of pain.

It's also tempting to make generalized statements about the situation in an
attempt to soothe your friend. You cannot know that your friend's loved one
"finished their work here," or that they are in a "better place." These
future-based, omniscient, generalized platitudes aren't helpful. Stick with the
truth: this hurts. I love you. I'm here.

#3 Do not try to fix the unfixable.
Your friend's loss cannot be fixed or repaired or solved. The pain itself
cannot be made better. Please see #2. Do not say anything that tries to fix the
unfixable, and you will do just fine. It is an unfathomable relief to have a
friend who does not try to take the pain away.

#4 Be willing to witness searing, unbearable pain.
To do #4 while also practicing #3 is very, very hard.

#5 This is not about you.
Being with someone in pain is not easy. You will have things come up --
stresses, questions, anger, fear, guilt. Your feelings will likely be hurt. You
may feel ignored and unappreciated. Your friend cannot show up for their part
of the relationship very well. Please don't take it personally, and please
don't take it out on them. Please find your own people to lean on at this time
-- it's important that you be supported while you support your friend. When in
doubt, refer to #1.

#6 Anticipate, don't ask.
Do not say "Call me if you need anything," because your friend will not call.
Not because they do not need, but because identifying a need, figuring out who
might fill that need, and then making a phone call to ask is light years beyond
their energy levels, capacity or interest. Instead, make concrete offers: "I
will be there at 4 p.m. on Thursday to bring your recycling to the curb," or "I
will stop by each morning on my way to work and give the dog a quick walk." Be
reliable.

#7 Do the recurring things.
The actual, heavy, real work of grieving is not something you can do (see #1),
but you can lessen the burden of "normal" life requirements for your friend.
Are there recurring tasks or chores that you might do? Things like walking the
dog, refilling prescriptions, shoveling snow and bringing in the mail are all
good choices. Support your friend in small, ordinary ways -- these things are
tangible evidence of love.

Please try not to do anything that is irreversible -- like doing laundry or
cleaning up the house -- unless you check with your friend first. That empty
soda bottle beside the couch may look like trash, but may have been left there
by their husband just the other day. The dirty laundry may be the last thing
that smells like her. Do you see where I'm going here? Tiny little normal
things become precious. Ask first.

#8 Tackle projects together.
Depending on the circumstance, there may be difficult tasks that need tending
-- things like casket shopping, mortuary visits, the packing and sorting of
rooms or houses. Offer your assistance and follow through with your offers.
Follow your friend's lead in these tasks. Your presence alongside them is
powerful and important; words are often unnecessary. Remember #4: bear witness
and be there.

#9 Run interference.
To the new griever, the influx of people who want to show their support can be
seriously overwhelming. What is an intensely personal and private time can
begin to feel like living in a fish bowl. There might be ways you can shield
and shelter your friend by setting yourself up as the designated point person
-- the one who relays information to the outside world, or organizes
well-wishers. Gatekeepers are really helpful.

#10 Educate and advocate.
You may find that other friends, family members and casual acquaintances ask
for information about your friend. You can, in this capacity, be a great
educator, albeit subtly. You can normalize grief with responses like,"She has
better moments and worse moments and will for quite some time. An intense loss
changes every detail of your life." If someone asks you about your friend a
little further down the road, you might say things like, "Grief never really
stops. It is something you carry with you in different ways."

#11 Love.
Above all, show your love. Show up. Say something. Do something. Be willing to
stand beside the gaping hole that has opened in your friend's life, without
flinching or turning away. Be willing to not have any answers. Listen. Be
there. Be present. Be a friend. Be love. Love is the thing that lasts.

Friends Get You Moving
Research presented in 2012 found that something you might expect more from your
mother -- nagging -- can actually work when it's coming from a pal who's
pushing you to move more. In fact, the least active interviewees in this
particular survey said they needed and even appreciated a nudge now and then
from friends. And working out with a friend has the added benefit of keeping
you committed to your workout plan. There's no rolling over to hit the snooze
button on that a.m. run if someone is waiting for you to show up! Flickr photo

Friends Keep You Relaxed
There's some truth behind friendship clichés like "a shoulder to cry on." In
the face of great stress, talking with and leaning on friends really can help
you get through troublesome times. A 2011 study found that among students,
friendships helped reduce some of the stress of being bullied or excluded at
school. Women in particular may be predisposed to the calming benefits of
friendship. Researchers found that females release the hormone oxytocin when
stressed, which encourages "tend and befriend" behavior, rather than the "fight
or flight" reaction often observed in men, the San Francisco Chronicle
reported. This encourages women to chat with their friends when stressed, and
the chatting itself spurs the release of more oxytocin, which can have a
calming effect. Flickr photo by epSos.de

Friends Help You Live Longer
It's not quite as simple as connecting with friends and, poof, you're
guaranteed to live to 100. But there is a significant body of research linking
strong social ties to a longer lifespan. Australian research found that older
adults with more friends were 22 percent less likely to die during a 10-year
study than their peers with fewer friends. And in a recent analysis of 148
studies, researchers found that people with stronger relationships had a 50
percent greater chance of survival. Flickr photo by egor.gribanov

Friends Boost Cancer Survival Rates
While friendships may help you live longer in any situation, social ties have
also been linked specifically to overcoming cancer. A small 2005 study observed
61 women with advanced ovarian cancer. Higher levels of interleukin 6, a
protein marker for a more aggressive form of the disease, were found in the
women with the weakest social bonds. An older study followed 86 women with
metastatic breast cancer for a year and found that the women who participated
in a weekly support group lived twice as long.

Friends Lower Heart Disease Risk
Perhaps because of their relaxation powers, friends are also good for the
heart. A 2005 analysis of social support theories found that weak social ties
could double heart disease risk. The link between social support and a healthy
heart is even stronger for men who make one very special social tie official.
Married men seem to experience a particular boost in heart health, WebMD
reported. Stronger social ties in general seem to lower blood pressure, which
helps the heart. Flickr photo by Brent Gambrell
